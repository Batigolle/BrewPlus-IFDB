      <revision number="1">2015</revision>
      <section>
        <paragraph>In order to reduce the size of style descriptions, we use some basic shorthand or jargon to represent more complex thoughts, and we also omit some items that should only be noted in exception circumstances. Some terminology may have different meanings in certain parts of the world, so we define our usages to avoid confusion. We also identify certain characteristics that are assumed not to be present in all beer styles so we don’t have to repeat those restrictions in every style.</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Basic Categorization</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>The most general categorization of beer styles by yeast type is a modern craft brewing phenomenon. American brewers and most other craft brewers call beers <em>ales</em> if they use top-fermenting (ale) yeast and <em>lagers</em>  if they use bottom-fermenting (lager) yeast. Most categorization systems will allow for a third classification, often called spontaneously-fermented because of the method; however, <em>wild</em> is perhaps a more widely-used modern craft beer term for these beers fermented with bacteria or non-saccharomyces yeast. The term <em>wild</em> in this context does not imply spontaneous fermentation; most are directly inoculated with the desired fermentation strains.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In Germany and other old world brewing centers, the terminology most typically used to differentiate beers is to refer to them as <em>top-fermenting</em> or <em>bottom-fermenting</em>. Germans think of ale as a type of English beer, and lager as a method of conditioning beer. So Germans would typically speak of Kölsch as a top-fermenting lager beer, not an ale.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>English brewers, particularly when dealing in a historical context, might separate ales from porters and stouts as types of beer (although in the next breath, saying there is no difference between porters and stouts). When dealing in even more historical contexts, they might go even further to describe ale as distinct from beer in that beer was hopped (or more highly hopped) than ale. These historical notes are important for understanding old recipes and writings, but have little relevance today in the common usages of terms describing beer.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>These guidelines attempt to use the modern craft beer definitions of <em>ale</em>, <em>lager</em>, and <em>wild</em> as the major groupings of beer styles, but will mention how they might be described in local or regional contexts, if possible.</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Common Attributes of All Beer Styles</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>The attributes discussed in this section are assumed to be present in every beer style description unless otherwise noted. It is not necessary to repeat all these characteristics for every style description. <em>Do not assume that since a characteristic (such as diacetyl) isn’t mentioned in a style description that somehow it is allowable.</em></paragraph>
        <paragraph><span class="underlined">Unless explicitly noted in an individual style description</span>, all beer styles are assumed to be cleanly fermented and free from technical faults, including acetaldehyde, astringency, chlorophenols, diacetyl, DMS, fusel alcohol, and phenolics. All beer styles are assumed to be free of packaging and handling faults, including oxidation, light-struck, sour, and musty characteristics.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In mouthfeel, all beers are assumed to be free from astringency, and not be creamy or have any other palate sensations unless otherwise noted. Beers with an alcohol level of 6% or less are assumed to not have the flavor or warming nature of alcohol, unless otherwise noted. Higher-alcohol beers that have a noticeable alcohol presence should not be harsh, hot, solventy, or burning. The alcohol character if noted, should be clean and not have fusel alcohols.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Lagers tend to be smooth, clean, and free of esters, but may have slight yeast-derived sulfur notes that are often fleeting. Styles made with a large amount of Pilsner malt may have low DMS notes; this is not a fault, but it is also not required unless otherwise noted. In both cases, the small amounts of sulfur and/or DMS should not be taken as meaning that prominent quantities are somehow desirable – they’re not. Just be aware that the use of some traditional ingredients often leave small sensory indications of their presence that might be considered faults in other contexts; that is perfectly acceptable, although not required.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Unless otherwise noted, assume all lagers to not have any fruitiness (esters). Ales tend to be less smooth than lagers, so unless otherwise noted, assume all ales may have some esters (not required, but not a fault).</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Glossary</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>Some terminology used in the style guidelines may be unfamiliar to some readers. Rather than include a complete dictionary, we have highlighted a few terms that either may not be well understood, or that imply specific meanings within the guidelines. Sometimes ingredient names are used as a shorthand for the character they provide to beer. When judges use these terms, they don’t necessarily imply that those specific ingredients have been used, just that the perceived characteristics match those commonly provided by the mentioned ingredients.</paragraph>

          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>American hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>modern American brewing hops from the craft beer era, typically having citrusy, resiny, evergreen, or similar characteristics. More modern hops can add even more unusual and experimental characteristics, such as stone fruit, berry, and melon.</definition>

            <definitionterm>Old World hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>traditional European brewing hops, including Saazer-type hops, British brewing hops, and those other varieties from continental Europe. Typically described as floral, spicy, herbal, or earthy. Generally less intense than many New World hops.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>New World hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>American hops, along with those from Australia and New Zealand, and other non-Old World locations. Can have all the attributes of classic American hops, as well as tropical fruit, stone fruit, white grape, and other interesting aromatics.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Saazer-type hops</definitionterm>
            <definition>often called noble hops, traditionally among the finest continental European brewing hops. Often having a lightly floral, spicy, or herbal character; rarely brash and aggressive, typically more subtle and elegant in nature.</definition>

        <definitionlist>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Munich malt</definitionterm>
            <definition>can provide a bready, richly malty quality that enhances the malt backbone of a beer without adding residual sweetness, although some can confuse maltiness with sweetness. Darker Munich malts can add a deeply toasted malt quality similar to toasted bread crusts.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Vienna malt</definitionterm>
            <definition>can provide a bready-toasty malt presence, but don’t expect the toasted notes to be extreme – they’re more like untoasted bread crusts than toasted bread.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Pilsner or Pils malt</definitionterm>
            <definition>continental Pilsner malt is quite distinctive, and has a slightly sweet, lightly grainy character with a soft, slightly toasty, honey-like quality. Higher in DMS precursors than other malts, its use can sometimes result in a low corny DMS flavor.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Maillard products</definitionterm>
            <definition>a class of compounds produced from complex interactions between sugars and amino acids at high temperatures, resulting in brown colors and rich, malty, sometimes even somewhat meaty compounds. In previous versions of the guidelines, known as melanoidins, which are a subset of Maillard products responsible for red-brown colors (and, according to Kunze, are “aroma-intensive”). In some brewing literature, melanoidin and Maillard product are used interchangeably. The chemistry and flavor characterization is not well understood, so brewers and judges should avoid excessively pedantic discussions around these points. The takeaway is that we mean the richly malty flavors, and need some kind of convenient shorthand to discuss them. Maillard is pronounced, roughly, as “my-YARD.”</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Biscuity</definitionterm>
            <definition>dry, toasted grain, flour, or dough flavor reminiscent of English digestive biscuits; in brewing, a flavor commonly associated with Biscuit malt and some traditional English malts.</definition>

        <sectiontitle>Yeast or Fermentation Terms</sectiontitle>
        <definitionlist>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Clean fermentation profile</definitionterm>
            <definition>the quality of having very low to no yeast-derived fermentation by-products in the finished beer, typically implying that there are no esters, diacetyl, acetaldehyde, or similar components, except if specifically mentioned. A shorthand for saying that the long list of possible fermentation by-products are not present in significant or appreciable quantities (barely perceived trace quantities at the threshold of perception are typically acceptable, nonetheless).</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Pome fruit</definitionterm>
            <definition>apple, pear, quince. The botanical classification contains other fruit, but these are the common ones we mean.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Stone fruit</definitionterm>
            <definition>fleshy fruit with a single pit (or stone), such as cherry, plum, peach, apricot, mango, etc.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Brett</definitionterm>
            <definition>shorthand term for <em>Brettanomyces</em>, an attenuative genus of yeast that often is used to produce fruity or funky complex flavors (leather, sweat, funk, etc.) in fermented beverages. Literally means “British fungus” and is often associated with qualities produced during barrel aging. Common species used in brewing include <em>B. bruxellensis</em> and <em>B. anomalous</em>, although they are sometimes knownby other names; several strains exist with very different profiles (as with <em>S.cerevisiae</em>). May be used as a primary fermentation or secondary fermentation strain.</definition>

          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Adjunct quality</definitionterm>
            <definition>a characteristic of beer aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel that reflects the use of higher percentages of non-malt fermentables. Can present as a corny character, a lighter body than an all-malt product, or a generally thinner-tasting beer. Does not necessarily imply the use of any specific adjunct.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>DMS</definitionterm>
            <definition>Dimethyl Sulfide, which can take on a wide range of perceptual characteristics. Most are inappropriate in any style of beer; however, a light cooked corn quality may be apparent in beers with high levels of Pilsner malt. When the guidelines state that any levels of DMS are appropriate, it is this light cooked corn flavor, not other cooked vegetable characteristics or other DMS flavors.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Rustic</definitionterm>
            <definition>coarse, hearty, robust character reminiscent of older, traditional ingredients; perhaps less refined as a general sensory experience.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Elegant</definitionterm>
            <definition>smooth, tasteful, refined, pleasant character suggestive of high quality ingredients handled with care; lacking rough edges, sharp flavors, and palate-attacking sensations.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Funky</definitionterm>
            <definition>A positive or negative term, depending on the context. If expected or desirable, can often take on a barnyard, wet hay, slightly earthy, horse blanket, or farmyard character. If too intense, unexpected, or undesirable, can take the form of silage, fecal, baby diaper, or horse stall qualities.</definition>

            <definitionterm>Belgian Lace (Lacing)</definitionterm>
            <definition>a characteristic and persistent latticework pattern of foam left on the inside of the glass as a beer is consumed. The look is reminiscent of fine lacework from Brussels or Belgium, and is a desirable indicator of beer quality in Belgium.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Legs</definitionterm>
            <definition>a pattern that a beverage leaves on the inside of a glass after a portion has been consumed. The term refers to the droplets that slowly fall in streams from beverage residue on the side of the glass. Not an indication of quality, but can indicate a higher alcohol, sugar, or glycerol content.</definition>

        <sectiontitle>Color Reference</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>Note that SRM is a measure of beer color density more than hue/tint. Keep this in mind when attempting to use only SRM numbers when describing beers. Within these Guidelines, beer color descriptors generally follow this mapping to SRM values:</paragraph>

        <sectiontitle>Style Organization</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>The beer styles described in the guidelines have been categorized to assist with running homebrew competitions. Categories (the major groupings of styles) are artificial constructs that represent a collection of individual sub-categories (beer styles) that may or may not have any historical, geographic, or traditional relationship with each other. Do not infer that membership in a style category somehow relates beer styles with each other. The only reason why they are grouped together is to assist with managing the scale and complexity of competitions. The names given to the groupings are for competition purposes only, and may not be used in any broader contexts in the beer and brewing industries.</paragraph>
        <paragraph><strong>Competitions do not have to judge each style category separately</strong>; they may be combined, split, or otherwise reorganized for competition purposes. Competition organizers are free to combine style sub-categories into their own competition categories. As long as each submitted beer is judged against the identified sub-category (style), any logical grouping is permitted.</paragraph>

      <section>
        <sectiontitle>Style Tag Reference</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>To assist with regrouping styles for other purposes, we have added informational tags to each style. These tags indicate certain attributes of the beer that may be used for grouping purposes. The ‘meaning’ column explains the general intent of the tag, but is not meant to be rigorous, formal definition. In no way do the tags supersede the actual descriptions of the style.</paragraph>

      <name>Standard American Beer</name>
      <notes>This category describes everyday American beers that have a wide public appeal. Containing both ales and lagers, the beers of this category are not typically complex, and have smooth, accessible flavors. The ales tend to have lager-like qualities, or are designed to appeal to mass-market lager drinkers as crossover beers. Mass-market beers with a more international appeal or origin are described in the International Lager category.</notes>
      <subcategory id="1A">
        <name>American Light Lager</name>
        <impression>Highly carbonated, very light-bodied, nearly flavorless lager designed to be consumed very cold. Very refreshing and thirst quenching.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to no malt aroma, although it can be perceived as grainy, sweet, or corn-like if present. Hop aroma is light to none, with a spicy or floral hop character if present. While a clean fermentation character is desirable, a light amount of yeast character (particularly a light apple fruitiness) is not a fault. Light DMS is not a fault.</aroma>
        <appearance>Very pale straw to pale yellow color. White, frothy head seldom persists. Very clear.</appearance>
        <flavor>Relatively neutral palate with a crisp and dry finish and a low to very low grainy or corn-like flavor that might be perceived as sweetness due to the low bitterness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels, and can have a floral, spicy, or herbal quality (although rarely strong enough to detect). Low to very low hop bitterness. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels of carbonation may accentuate the crispness of the dry finish. Clean lager fermentation character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Very light (sometimes watery) body. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on the tongue.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Designed to appeal to as broad a range of the general public as possible. Strong flavors are a fault.</comments>
        <history>Coors briefly made a light lager in the early 1940s. Modern versions were first produced by Rheingold in 1967 to appeal to diet-conscious drinkers, but only became popular starting in 1973 after Miller Brewing acquired the recipe and marketed the beer heavily to sports fans with the “tastes great, less filling” campaign. Beers of this genre became the largest sellers in the United States in the 1990s.</history>
        <ingredients>Two- or six-row barley with high percentage (up to 40%) of rice or corn as adjuncts. Additional enzymes can further lighten the body and lower carbohydrates.</ingredients>
        <comparison>A lighter-bodied, lower-alcohol, lower calorie version of an American Lager. Less hop character and bitterness than a Leichtbier.</comparison>

        <impression>A very pale, highly-carbonated, light-bodied, well-attenuated lager with a very neutral flavor profile and low bitterness. Served very cold, it can be a very refreshing and thirst quenching drink.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to no malt aroma, although it can be perceived as grainy, sweet or corn-like if present. Hop aroma may range from none to a light, spicy or floral hop presence. While a clean fermentation character is desirable, a light amount of yeast character (particularly a light apple character) is not a fault. Light DMS is also not a fault.</aroma>
        <appearance>Very pale straw to medium yellow color. White, frothy head seldom persists. Very clear.</appearance>
        <flavor>Relatively neutral palate with a crisp and dry finish and a moderately-low to low grainy or corn-like flavor that might be perceived as sweetness due to the low bitterness. Hop flavor ranges from none to moderately-low levels, and can have a floral, spicy, or herbal quality (although often not strong enough to distinguish). Hop bitterness at low to medium-low level. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels of carbonation may accentuate the crispness of the dry finish. Clean lager fermentation character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Low to medium-low body. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on the tongue.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Strong flavors are a fault. Often what non-craft beer drinkers expect to be served if they order <em>beer</em> in the United States. May be marketed as Pilsner beers outside of Europe, but should not be confused with traditional examples.</comments>
        <history>Although German immigrants had brewed traditional Pilsner-inspired lager beer in the United States since the mid-late 1800s, the modern American lager style was heavily influenced by Prohibition and World War II. Surviving breweries consolidated, expanded distribution, and heavily promoted a beer style that was appealing to a broad range of the population. Became the dominant beer style for many decades, and spawning many international rivals who would develop similarly bland products for the mass market supported by heavy advertising.</history>
        <ingredients>Two- or six-row barley with high percentage (up to 40%) of rice or corn as adjuncts.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Stronger, more flavor and body than a Light American Lager. Less bitterness and flavor than an International Lager. Significantly less flavor, hops, and bitterness than traditional European Pilsners.</comparison>

        <name>Cream Ale</name>
        <impression>A clean, well-attenuated, flavorful American “lawnmower” beer. Easily drinkable and refreshing, with more character than typical American lagers.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium-low to low malt notes, with a sweet, corn-like aroma. Low levels of DMS are allowable, but are not required. Hop aroma medium low to none, and can be of any variety although floral, spicy, or herbal notes are most common. Overall, a subtle aroma with neither hops nor malt dominating. Low fruity esters are optional.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale straw to moderate gold color, although usually on the pale side. Low to medium head with medium to high carbonation. Fair head retention. Brilliant, sparkling clarity.</appearance>
        <flavor>Low to medium-low hop bitterness. Low to moderate maltiness and sweetness, varying with gravity and attenuation. Usually well-attenuated. Neither malt nor hops dominate the palate. A low to moderate corny flavor is commonly found, as is light DMS (optional). Finish can vary from somewhat dry to faintly sweet. Low fruity esters are optional. Low to medium-low hop flavor (any variety, but typically floral, spicy, or herbal).</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Generally light and crisp, although body can reach medium. Smooth mouthfeel with medium to high attenuation; higher attenuation levels can lend a “thirst quenching” quality. High carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Pre-prohibition Cream Ales were slightly stronger, hoppier (including some dry hopping) and more bitter (25-30+ IBUs). These versions should be entered in the historical category. Most commercial examples are in the 1.050-1.053 OG range, and bitterness rarely rises above 20 IBUs.</comments>
        <history>A sparkling or present-use ale that existed in the 1800s and survived prohibition. An ale version of the American lager style. Produced by ale brewers to compete with lager brewers in Canada and the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest states. Originally known as sparkling or present use ales, lager strains were (and sometimes still are) used by some brewers, but were not historically mixed with ale strains. Many examples are kräusened to achieve carbonation. Cold conditioning isn’t traditional, although modern brewers sometimes use it.</history>
        <ingredients>American ingredients most commonly used. A grain bill of six-row malt, or a combination of six-row and North American two-row, is common. Adjuncts can include up to 20% maize in the mash, and up to 20% glucose or other sugars in the boil. Any variety of hops can be used for bittering and finishing.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar to a Standard American Lager, but with more character.</comparison>

        <name>American Wheat Beer</name>
        <impression>Refreshing wheat beers that can display more hop character and less yeast character than their German cousins. A clean fermentation character allows bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavors to be complemented by hop flavor and bitterness rather than yeast qualities.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to moderate grainy, bready, or doughy wheat character. A light to moderate malty sweetness is acceptable. Esters can be moderate to none, although should reflect relatively neutral yeast strains; banana is inappropriate. Hop aroma may be low to moderate, and can have a citrusy, spicy, floral, or fruity character. No clove phenols.</aroma>
        <appearance>Usually pale yellow to gold. Clarity may range from brilliant to hazy with yeast approximating the German weissbier style of beer. Big, long-lasting white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Light to moderately-strong bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavor, which can linger into the finish. May have a moderate malty sweetness or finish quite dry. Low to moderate hop bitterness, which sometimes lasts into the finish. Balance is usually even, but may be slightly bitter. Low to moderate hop flavor (citrusy, spicy, floral, or fruity). Esters can be moderate to none, but should not include banana. No clove phenols. May have a slightly crisp finish.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body. Medium-high to high carbonation. Slight creaminess is optional; wheat beers sometimes have a soft, ‘fluffy’ impression.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Different variations exist, from an easy-drinking fairly sweet beer to a dry, aggressively-hopped beer with a strong wheat flavor. American rye beers should be entered in the Alternative Fermentables specialty category.</comments>
        <history>An American craft beer adaptation of the German weissbier style using a cleaner yeast and more hops, first widely popularized by Widmer in the mid-1980s.</history>
        <ingredients>Clean American ale or lager yeast (German weissbier yeast is inappropriate). Large proportion of wheat malt (often 30-50%, which is lower than is typical in German weissbiers). American, German, or New World hops are typical.</ingredients>
        <comparison>More hop character and less yeast character than German weissbier. Never with the banana and clove character of German weissbier. Generally can have the same range and balance as Blonde Ales, but with a wheat character as the primary malt flavor.</comparison>

      <name>International Lager</name>
      <notes>International lagers are the premium mass-market lagers produced in most countries in the world. Whether developed from American or European styles, they all tend to have a fairly uniform character and are heavily marketed. Loosely derived from original Pilsner-type lagers, with colored variations having additional malt flavors while retaining a broad appeal to most palates. In many countries, the styles will be referred to by their local country names. The use of the term “international” doesn’t mean that any beers are actually labeled as such; it is more of a categorization of similar beers produced worldwide.</notes>
      <subcategory id="2A">
        <name>International Pale Lager</name>
        <impression>A highly-attenuated pale lager without strong flavors, typically well-balanced and highly carbonated. Served cold, it is refreshing and thirst-quenching.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to medium-low malt aroma, which can be grainy-malty or slightly corny-sweet. Hop aroma may range from very low to a medium, spicy or floral hop presence. While a clean fermentation profile is generally most desirable, low levels of yeast character (such as a light apple fruitiness) are not a fault. A light amount of DMS or corn aroma is not a fault.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale straw to gold color. White, frothy head may not be long lasting. Very clear.</appearance>
        <flavor>Low to moderate levels of grainy-malt flavor, with a crisp, dry, well-attenuated finish. The grain character can be somewhat neutral, or show a light bready-crackery quality or up to moderate corny or malty sweetness. Hop flavor ranges from none to medium levels, and often showing a floral, spicy, or herbal character if detected. Hop bitterness at medium-low to medium level. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. Neutral aftertaste with light malt and sometimes hop flavors. A light amount of DMS is not a fault.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium body. Moderately high to highly carbonated. Can have a slight carbonic bite on the tongue.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>International lagers tend to have fewer adjuncts than standard American lagers. They may be all-malt, although strong flavors are still a fault. A broad category of international mass-market lagers ranging from up-scale American lagers to the typical “import” or “green bottle” international beers found in America and many export markets. Often confusingly labeled as a “Pilsner.” Any skunkiness in commercial beers from being lightstruck in a green bottle is a mishandling fault, not a characteristic of the style.</comments>
        <history>In the United States, developed as a premium version of the standard American lager, with a similar history. Outside the United States, developed either as an imitation of American style lagers, or as a more accessible (and often drier and less bitter) version of a Pilsner-type beer. Often heavily marketed and exported by large industrial or multi-national breweries.</history>
        <ingredients>Two- or six-row barley. May use rice, corn, or sugar as adjuncts, or may be all malt.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Generally more bitter and filling than American lager. Less hoppy and bitter than a German Pils. Less body, malt flavor, and hop character than a Czech Premium Pale Lager.

      <name>Czech Lager</name>
      <notes>Czech lagers are generally divided by gravity class (draft, lager, special) and color (pale, amber, dark). The Czech names for these categories are <em>světlé</em> (pale), <em>polotmavé</em> (amber), and <em>tmavé</em> (dark). The gravity classes are <em>výčepní</em> (draft, 7 - 10 °P), <em>ležák</em> (lager, 11 - 12 °P), and <em>speciální</em> (special, 13 °P+). <em>Pivo</em> is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar to the German groupings of <em>schankbier</em>, <em>vollbier</em>, and <em>starkbier</em>, although at different gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings, particularly within the <em>speciální</em> class. The style guidelines combine some of these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as the strong Czech Porter). This is not to imply that the categories below are the full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly found types for judging purposes.</notes>
      <notes>Czech lagers in general are differentiated from German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile, while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7 - 10 °C) and for a longer time, and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes Czech lagers.</notes>

        <name>Czech Pale Lager</name>
        <impression>A lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing, hoppy, bitter pale Czech lager having the familiar flavors of the stronger Czech Premium Pale Lager (Pilsner-type) beer but in a lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.</impression>
        <aroma>Light to moderate bready-rich malt combined with light to moderate spicy or herbal hop bouquet; the balance between the malt and hops may vary. Faint hint of caramel is acceptable. Light (but never intrusive) diacetyl and light, fruity hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present. No sulfur.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light gold to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear, with a long-lasting, creamy white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium-low to medium bready-rich malt flavor with a rounded, hoppy finish. Low to medium-high spicy or herbal hop flavor. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. Flavorful and refreshing. Diacetyl or fruity esters are acceptable at low levels, but need not be present and should never be overbearing.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body. Moderate carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The Czech name of the style is <em>světlé výčepní pivo</em>.</comments>
        <history>Josef Groll initially brewed two types of beer in 1842-3, a <em>výčepní</em> and a <em>ležák</em>, with the smaller beer having twice the production; Evan Rail speculates that these were probably 10 <em>°</em>P and 12 <em>°</em>P beers, but that the <em>výčepní</em> could have been weaker. This is the most consumed type of beer in the Czech Republic at present.</history>

        <name>Czech Premium Pale Lager</name>
        <impression>Rich, characterful, pale Czech lager, with considerable malt and hop character and a long, rounded finish. Complex yet well-balanced and refreshing. The malt flavors are complex for a Pilsner-type beer, and the bitterness is strong but clean and without harshness, which gives a rounded impression that enhances drinkability.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium to medium-high bready-rich malt and medium-low to medium-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop bouquet; though the balance between the malt and hops may vary, the interplay is rich and complex. Light diacetyl, or very low fruity hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present.</aroma>
        <appearance>Gold to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear clarity. Dense, long-lasting, creamy white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Rich, complex, bready maltiness combined with a pronounced yet soft and rounded bitterness and floral and spicy hop flavor. Malt and hop flavors are medium to medium-high, and the malt may contain a slight impression of caramel. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. The long finish can be balanced towards hops or malt but is never aggressively tilted either way. Light to moderate diacetyl and low hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body. Moderate to low carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Generally a group of <em>pivo Plzeňského typu</em> , or Pilsner-type beers. This style is a combination of the Czech styles <em>světlý ležák</em> (11-12.9 <em>°</em>P) and <em>světlé speciální pivo</em> (13-14.9 <em>°</em>P). In the Czech Republic, only Pilsner Urquell is called a Pilsner, despite how widely adopted this name is worldwide. <em>Kvasnicové</em> (“yeast beer”) versions are popular in the Czech Republic, and may be either kräusened with yeasted wort or given a fresh dose of pure yeast after fermentation. These beers are sometimes cloudy, with subtle yeastiness and enhanced hop character. Modern examples vary in their malt to hop balance and many are not as hop-forward as Pilsner Urquell.</comments>
        <history>Commonly associated with Pilsner Urquell, which was first brewed in 1842 after construction of a new brewhouse by burghers dissatisfied with the standard of beer brewed in Plzeň. Bavarian brewer Josef Groll is credited with first brewing the beer.</history>
        <ingredients>Soft water with low sulfate and carbonate content, Saazer-type hops, Czech malt, Czech lager yeast. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates. The bitterness level of some larger commercial examples has dropped in recent years, although not as much as in many contemporary German examples.</ingredients>
        <comparison>More color, malt richness, and body than a German Pils, with a fuller finish and a cleaner, softer impression. Stronger than a Czech Pale Lager.</comparison>

        <comments>The Czech name of the style is <em>polotmavé pivo</em>, which translates as <em>half dark</em>. This style is a combination of the Czech styles <em>polotmavý ležák</em> (11-12.9 <em>°</em>P) and <em>polotmavé speciální pivo</em> (13-14.9 <em>°</em>P).</comments>
        <history>A Vienna-style lager which has continued to be brewed in the Czech Republic. A resurgence of small breweries opening in the Czech Republic has increased the number of examples of this style.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner and caramel malts, but Vienna and Munich malts may also be used. Low mineral content water, Saazer-type hops, Czech lager yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>The style can be similar to a Vienna lager but with Saazer-type hop character, or that approaching an English bitter but significantly richer with more of a deep caramel character. Large brewery versions are generally similar to Czech Premium Pale Lager with slightly darker malt flavors and less hop, while smaller breweries often make versions with considerable hop character, malt complexity, or residual sweetness.</comparison>

        <name>Munich Helles</name>
        <impression>A clean, malty, gold-colored German lager with a smooth grainy-sweet malty flavor and a soft, dry finish. Subtle spicy, floral, or herbal hops and restrained bitterness help keep the balance malty but not sweet, which helps make this beer a refreshing, everyday drink.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate grainy-sweet malt aroma. Low to moderately-low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma. While a clean aroma is most desirable, a very low background note of DMS is not a fault. Pleasant, clean fermentation profile, with malt dominating the balance. The freshest examples will have more of a malty-sweet aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium yellow to pale gold. Clear. Persistent creamy white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately malty start with the suggestion of sweetness, moderate grainy-sweet malt flavor with a soft, rounded palate impression, supported by a low to medium-low hop bitterness. The finish is soft and dry, not crisp and biting. Low to moderately-low spicy, floral or herbal hop flavor. The malt dominates the hops in the palate, finish, and aftertaste, but the hops should be noticeable. There should not be any residual sweetness, simply the impression of maltiness with restrained bitterness. Very fresh examples will seem sweeter due to the fresh, rich malt character that can fade with time. Clean fermentation profile.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body. Medium carbonation. Smooth, well-lagered character.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A fully-attenuated Pils malt showcase, Helles is a malt-accentuated beer that is not overly sweet, but rather focuses on malt flavor with underlying hop bitterness in a supporting role. Export examples can quickly lose some of the rich malt character that often suggests sweetness. Helles in Munich tends to be lighter in all aspects than those outside the city, which can be more assertive with more body, flavor, and hop character.</comments>
        <history>Created in Munich in 1894 at the Spaten brewery to compete with pale Pilsner-type beers. Currently the most popular style in Southern Germany.</history>
        <ingredients>Continental Pilsner malt, traditional German Saazer-type hop varieties, clean German lager yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar in malt balance and bitterness to Munich Dunkel, but less malty-sweet in nature and pale rather than dark. More body and malt presence than a German Pils, with less hop character throughout. Similar malt profile as a German Exportbier, but with less hops in the balance.</comparison>

        <name>Festbier</name>
        <impression>A smooth, clean, pale German lager with a moderately strong malty flavor and a light hop character. Deftly balances strength and drinkability, with a palate impression and finish that encourages drinking. Showcases elegant German malt flavors without becoming too heavy or filling.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate malty richness, with an emphasis on toasty-doughy aromatics and an impression of sweetness. Low to medium-low floral, herbal, or spicy hops. The malt should not have a deeply toasted, caramel, or biscuity quality. Clean lager fermentation character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep yellow to deep gold color; should not have amber hues. Bright clarity. Persistent white to off-white foam stand. Most commercial examples are medium gold in color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to medium-high malty flavor initially, with a lightly toasty, bread dough quality and an impression of soft sweetness. Medium to medium-low bitterness, definitely malty in the balance. Well-attenuated and crisp, but not dry. Medium-low to medium floral, herbal, or spicy hop flavor. Clean lager fermentation character. The taste is mostly of Pils malt, but with slightly toasty hints. The bitterness is supportive, but still should yield a malty, flavorful finish.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body, with a smooth, somewhat creamy texture. Medium carbonation. Alcohol strength barely noticeable as warming, if at all.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>This style represents the modern German beer served at Oktoberfest (although it is not solely reserved for Oktoberfest; it can be found at many other ‘fests’), and is sometimes called Wiesn (“the meadow” or local name for the Oktoberfest festival). We chose to call this style <em>Festbier</em> since by German and EU regulations, <em>Oktoberfestbier</em> is a protected appellation for beer produced at large breweries within the Munich city limits for consumption at Oktoberfest. Other countries are not bound by these rules, so many craft breweries in the US produce beer called Oktoberfest, but based on the traditional style described in these guidelines as <em>Märzen</em>.</comments>
        <history>Since 1990, the majority of beer served at Oktoberfest in Munich has been this style. Export beer specifically made for the United States is still mainly of the traditional amber style, as are US-produced interpretations. Paulaner first created the golden version in the mid-1970s because they thought the traditional Oktoberfest was too filling. So they developed a lighter, more drinkable but still malty version that they wanted to be “more poundable” (according to the head brewer at Paulaner). But the actual type of beer served at Oktoberfest is set by a Munich city committee.</history>
        <ingredients>Majority Pils malt, but with some Vienna and/or Munich malt to increase maltiness. Differences in commercial examples are mostly due to different maltsters and yeast, not major grist differences.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Less intense and less richly toasted than a Märzen. More rich-heavy in body than a Helles, with more hop flavor and higher alcohol. Less rich in malt intensity than a Maibock. The malt complexity is similar to a higher-gravity Czech Premium Pale Lager, although without the associated hops.</comparison>

        <name>Helles Bock</name>
        <impression>A relatively pale, strong, malty German lager beer with a nicely attenuated finish that enhances drinkability. The hop character is generally more apparent than in other bocks.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate to strong grainy-sweet malt aroma, often with a lightly toasted quality and low Maillard products. Moderately-low to no hop aroma, often with a spicy, herbal, or floral quality. Clean fermentation profile. Fruity esters should be low to none. Very light alcohol may be noticeable. May have a light DMS aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep gold to light amber in color. Bright to clear clarity. Large, creamy, persistent, white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately to moderately strong grainy-sweet malt flavor dominates with some toasty notes and/or Maillard products providing added interest. Little to no caramel flavors. May have a light DMS flavor. Moderate to no hop flavor (spicy, herbal, floral, peppery). Moderate hop bitterness (more so in the balance than in other bocks). Clean fermentation profile. Well-attenuated, not cloying, with a moderately-dry finish that may taste of both malt and hops.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-bodied. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation. Smooth and clean with no harshness or astringency, despite the increased hop bitterness. A light alcohol warming may be present.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Also known as Mai Bock, but there is some dispute whether Helles (“pale”) Bock and Mai (“May”) Bock are synonymous. Most agree that they are identical, but some believe that Maibock is a “fest” type beer hitting the upper limits of hopping and color for the range. Any fruitiness is due to Munich and other specialty malts, not yeast-derived esters developed during fermentation. The hops compensate for the lower level of Maillard products.</comments>
        <history>A fairly recent development in comparison to the other members of the bock family. The serving of Maibock is specifically associated with springtime and the month of May.</history>
        <ingredients>Base of Pils and/or Vienna malt with some Munich malt to add character (although much less than in a traditional bock). No non-malt adjuncts. Saazer-type hops. Clean lager yeast. Decoction mash is typical, but boiling is less than in Dunkles Bock to restrain color development.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Can be thought of as either a pale version of a Dunkles Bock, or a Munich Helles brewed to bock strength. While quite malty, this beer typically has less dark and rich malt flavors, and can be drier, hoppier, and more bitter than a Dunkles Bock. Has more of a rich malt character and more alcohol than a Festbier.</comparison>

      <notes>This category describes German-origin beers that are pale and have an even to bitter balance with a mild to moderately strong hoppy character featuring classic German hops. They are generally bottom-fermented or are lagered to provide a smooth profile, and are well-attenuated as are most German beers.</notes>

        <name>German Leichtbier</name>
        <impression>A pale, highly-attenuated, light-bodied German lager with lower alcohol and calories than normal-strength beers. Moderately bitter with noticeable malt and hop flavors, the beer is still interesting to drink.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to medium hop aroma, with a spicy, herbal, or floral character. Low to medium-low grainy-sweet or slightly crackery malt aroma. Clean fermentation profile.</aroma>
        <appearance>Straw to pale gold in color. Brilliant clarity. Moderate white head with average to below average persistence.</appearance>

        <mouthfeel>Light to very light body. Medium to high carbonation. Smooth, well-attenuated.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Marketed primarily as a diet-oriented beer with lower carbohydrates, alcohol, and calories. Pronounced “LYESHT-beer.” May also be known as a Diat Pils or Helles, this style is in the schankbier gravity class. Other variations of Leicht class beers can be made from Weissbier, Kölsch, and Altbier; those beers are best entered in the <em>Mixed-Style Beer</em> category.</comments>
        <history>Traditional versions existed as drinks for physical laborers in factories or fields, but modern versions are more based on popular American products in the same class.</history>
        <ingredients>Similar to a German Pils or Helles, continental Pils malt, German lager yeast, Saazer-type hops.</ingredients>

        <impression>A clean, crisp, delicately-balanced beer usually with a very subtle fruit and hop character. Subdued maltiness throughout leads into a pleasantly well-attenuated and refreshing finish. Freshness makes a huge difference with this beer, as the delicate character can fade quickly with age. Brilliant clarity is characteristic.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to very low malt aroma, with a grainy-sweet character. A pleasant, subtle fruit aroma from fermentation (apple, cherry or pear) is acceptable, but not always present. A low floral, spicy or herbal hop aroma is optional but not out of style. Some yeast strains may give a slight winy or sulfury character (this characteristic is also optional, but not a fault). Overall, the intensity of aromatics is fairly subtle but generally balanced, clean, and fresh.</aroma>
        <appearance>Very pale gold to light gold. Very clear (authentic commercial versions are filtered to a brilliant clarity). Has a delicate white head that may not persist.</appearance>
        <flavor>Soft, rounded palate comprised of a delicate flavor balance between soft yet attenuated malt, an almost imperceptible fruity sweetness from fermentation, and a medium-low to medium bitterness with a delicate dryness and slight crispness in the finish (but no harsh aftertaste). The malt tends to be grainy-sweet, possibly with a very light bready or honey quality. The hop flavor is variable, and can range from low to moderately-high; most are medium-low to medium intensity and have a floral, spicy, or herbal character. May have a malty-sweet impression at the start, but this is not required. No noticeable residual sweetness. May have a slightly winy, minerally, or sulfury accent that accentuates the dryness and flavor balance. A slight wheat taste is rare but not a fault. Otherwise, very clean.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body (most are medium-light). Medium to medium-high carbonation. Smooth and generally crisp and well-attenuated.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Characterized in Germany as a top-fermented, lagered beer. Each Köln brewery produces a beer of different character, and each interprets the <em>Kölsch Konvention</em> slightly differently. Allow for a range of variation within the style when judging. Note that drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU specifications might suggest. Due to its delicate flavor profile, Kölsch tends to have a relatively short shelf-life; older examples and imports can easily show some oxidation defects. Served in Köln in a tall, narrow 200ml glass called a <em>Stange</em>.</comments>
        <history>Cologne, Germany (Köln) has a top-fermenting brewing tradition since the Middle Ages, but developed the beer now known as Kölsch in the late 1800s to combat encroaching bottom-fermented pale lagers. Kölsch is an appellation protected by the <em>Kölsch Konvention</em> (1986), and is restricted to the 20 or so breweries in and around Köln. The <em>Konvention</em> simply defines the beer as a “light, highly attenuated, hop-accentuated, clear, top-fermenting <em>Vollbier</em>.”</history>
        <ingredients>Traditional German hops (Hallertau, Tettnang, Spalt or Hersbrucker). German Pils or pale malt. Attenuative, clean ale yeast. Up to 20% wheat malt may be used, but this is quite rare in authentic versions. Current commercial practice is to ferment warm, cold condition for a short period of time, and serve young.</ingredients>
        <comparison>To the untrained taster, easily mistaken for a cream ale or somewhat subtle Pils.</comparison>

        <impression>A pale, well-balanced, smooth German lager that is slightly stronger than the average beer with a moderate body and a mild, aromatic hop and malt character.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to medium hop aroma, typically floral, spicy, or herbal in character. Moderate grainy-sweet malt aroma. Clean fermentation profile. A slight sulfury note at the start that dissipates is not a fault, neither is a low background note of DMS.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light gold to deep gold. Clear. Persistent white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Neither grainy-sweet malt nor floral, spicy, or herbal hops dominate, but both are in good balance with a touch of malty sweetness, providing a smooth yet crisply refreshing beer. Balance continues through the finish and the hop bitterness lingers in aftertaste (although some examples may finish slightly sweet). Clean fermentation character. Some mineral character might be noted from the water, although it usually does not come across as an overt minerally flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body, medium carbonation. Smooth but crisp.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Sometimes known as Dortmunder or Dortmunder Export. Brewed to a slightly higher starting gravity than other light lagers, providing a firm malty body and underlying maltiness to complement the sulfate-accentuated hop bitterness. The term “Export” is a beer strength descriptor under German brewing tradition, and is not strictly synonymous with the “Dortmunder” style; beer from other cities or regions can be brewed to Export strength, and labeled as such (even if not necessarily exported).</comments>
        <history>The Dortmunder style developed in the Dortmund industrial region in the 1870s in response to pale Pilsner-type beers, it became very popular after World War II but declined in the 1970s. Other Export-class beers developed independently, and reflected a slightly stronger version of existing beers. The modern German style is typically 12-13 °P.</history>
        <ingredients>Minerally water with high levels of sulfates, carbonates and chlorides, German or Czech noble hops, Pilsner malt, German lager yeast. Newer commercial versions can contain adjuncts and hop extract.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Less finishing hops and more body than a Pils but more bitter than a Helles.</comparison>

        <impression>A light-bodied, highly-attenuated, gold-colored, bottom-fermented bitter German beer showing excellent head retention and an elegant, floral hop aroma. Crisp, clean, and refreshing, a German Pils showcases the finest quality German malt and hops.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium-low to low grainy-sweet-rich malt character (often with a light honey and slightly toasted cracker quality) and distinctive flowery, spicy, or herbal hops. Clean fermentation profile. May optionally have a very light sulfury note that comes from water as much as yeast. The hops are moderately-low to moderately-high, but should not totally dominate the malt presence. One-dimensional examples are inferior to the more complex qualities when all ingredients are sensed. May have a very low background note of DMS.</aroma>
        <appearance>Straw to light gold, brilliant to very clear, with a creamy, long-lasting white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to high hop bitterness dominates the palate and lingers into the aftertaste. Moderate to moderately-low grainy-sweet malt character supports the hop bitterness. Low to high floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor. Clean fermentation profile. Dry to medium-dry, crisp, well-attenuated finish with a bitter aftertaste and light malt flavor. Examples made with water with higher sulfate levels often will have a low sulfury flavor that accentuates the dryness and lengthens the finish; this is acceptable but not mandatory. Some versions have a soft finish with more of a malt flavor, but still with noticeable hop bitterness and flavor, with the balance still towards bitterness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light body. Medium to high carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Modern examples of Pils tend to become paler in color, drier in finish, and more bitter as you move from South to North in Germany, often mirroring the increase in sulfate in the water. The Pils found in Bavaria tend to be a bit softer in bitterness with more malt flavor and late hop character, yet still with sufficient hops and crispness of finish to differentiate itself from a Helles. The use of the term ‘Pils’ is more common in Germany than ‘Pilsner’ to differentiate it from the Czech style, and (some say) to show respect.</comments>
        <history>Adapted from Czech Pilsner to suit brewing conditions in Germany, particularly water with higher mineral content and domestic hop varieties. First brewed in Germany in the early 1870s. Became more popular after WWII as German brewing schools emphasized modern techniques. Along with its sister beer, Czech Pilsner, is the ancestor of the most widely produced beer styles today. Average IBUs of many well-regarded commercial examples have dropped over time.</history>
        <ingredients>Continental Pilsner malt, German hop varieties (especially Saazer-type varieties such as Tettnanger, Hallertauer, and Spalt for taste and aroma; Saaz is less common), German lager yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Lighter in body and color, drier, crisper, and more fully attenuated, with more of a lingering bitterness, and with higher carbonation than a Czech Premium Pale Lager. More hop character, malt flavor, and bitterness than International Pale Lagers. More hop character and bitterness with a drier, crisper finish than a Munich Helles; the Helles has more malt flavor, but of the same character as the Pils.</comparison>

        <impression>An elegant, malty German amber lager with a clean, rich, toasty and bready malt flavor, restrained bitterness, and a dry finish that encourages another drink. The overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate intensity aroma of German malt, typically rich, bready, somewhat toasty, with light bread crust notes. Clean lager fermentation character. No hop aroma. Caramel, dry-biscuity, or roasted malt aromas inappropriate. Very light alcohol might be detected, but should never be sharp. Clean, elegant malt richness should be the primary aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Amber-orange to deep reddish-copper color; should not be golden. Bright clarity, with persistent, off-white foam stand.</appearance>
        <flavor>Initial malt flavor often suggests sweetness, but finish is moderately-dry to dry. Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready, toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate, and the hop flavor is low to none (German types: complex, floral, herbal, or spicy). Hops provide sufficient balance that the malty palate and finish do not seem sweet. The aftertaste is malty, with the same elegant, rich malt flavors lingering. Noticeable caramel, biscuit, or roasted flavors are inappropriate. Clean lager fermentation profile.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body, with a smooth, creamy texture that often suggests a fuller mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Fully attenuated, without a sweet or cloying impression. May be slightly warming, but the strength should be relatively hidden.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Modern domestic German Oktoberfest versions are golden - see the <em>Festbier</em> style for this version. Export German versions (to the United States, at least) are typically orange-amber in color, have a distinctive toasty malt character, and are most often labeled <em>Oktoberfest</em>. American craft versions of Oktoberfest are generally based on this style, and most Americans will recognize this beer as <em>Oktoberfest</em>. Historic versions of the beer tended to be darker, towards the brown color range, but there have been many ‘shades’ of Märzen (when the name is used as a strength); this style description specifically refers to the stronger amber lager version. The modern <em>Festbier</em> can be thought of as a pale Märzen by these terms.</comments>
        <history>As the name suggests, brewed as a stronger “March beer” in March and lagered in cold caves over the summer. Modern versions trace back to the lager developed by Spaten in 1841, contemporaneous to the development of Vienna lager. However, the Märzen name is much older than 1841; the early ones were dark brown, and in Austria the name implied a strength band (14 °P) rather than a style. The German amber lager version (in the Viennese style of the time) was first served at Oktoberfest in 1872, a tradition that lasted until 1990 when the golden <em>Festbier</em> was adopted as the standard festival beer.</history>
        <ingredients>Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasized Munich malt. The notion of elegance is derived from the finest quality ingredients, particularly the base malts. A decoction mash was traditionally used to develop the rich malt profile.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Not as strong and rich as a Dunkles Bock. More malt depth and richness than a Festbier, with a heavier body and slightly less hops. Less hoppy and equally malty as a Czech Amber Lager.</comparison>

        <impression>An elegant, malty German amber lager with a balanced, complementary beechwood smoke character. Toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish are characteristic.</impression>
        <aroma>Blend of smoke and malt, with a varying balance and intensity. The beechwood smoke character can range from subtle to fairly strong, and can seem smoky, woody, or bacon-like. The malt character can be low to moderate, and be somewhat rich, toasty, or malty-sweet. The malt and smoke components are often inversely proportional (i.e., when smoke increases, malt decreases, and vice versa). Hop aroma may be very low to none. Clean lager fermentation character.</aroma>
        <appearance>This should be a very clear beer, with a large, creamy, rich, tan- to cream-colored head. Medium amber/light copper to dark brown color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Generally follows the aroma profile, with a blend of smoke and malt in varying balance and intensity, yet always complementary. Märzen-like qualities should be noticeable, particularly a malty, toasty richness, but the beechwood smoke flavor can be low to high. At higher levels, the smoke can take on a ham- or bacon-like character, which is acceptable as long as it doesn’t veer into the greasy range. The palate can be somewhat malty, rich, and sweet, yet the finish tends to be medium-dry to dry with the smoke character sometimes enhancing the dryness of the finish. The aftertaste can reflect both malt richness and smoke flavors, with a balanced presentation desirable. Moderate, balanced, hop bitterness. Moderate to none hop flavor with spicy, floral, or herbal notes. Clean lager fermentation character. Harsh, bitter, burnt, charred, rubbery, sulfury or phenolic smoky characteristics are inappropriate.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body. Medium to medium-high carbonation. Smooth lager character. Significant astringent, phenolic harshness is inappropriate.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Literally “smoke beer” in German. The intensity of smoke character can vary widely; not all examples are highly smoked. Allow for variation in the style when judging. Other examples of smoked beers are available in Germany based on styles such as Dunkles Bock, Weissbier, Dunkel, Schwarzbier, and Helles, including examples such as Spezial Lager; these should be entered in the Classic Style Smoked Beer category. This description specifically refers to the smoked Märzen version.</comments>
        <history>A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region of Bavaria in Germany. Beechwood-smoked malt is used to make a Märzen-style amber lager. The smoke character of the malt varies by maltster; some breweries produce their own smoked malt <em>(rauchmalz)</em>.</history>
        <ingredients>German Rauchmalz (beechwood-smoked Vienna-type malt) typically makes up 20-100% of the grain bill, with the remainder being German malts typically used in a Märzen. Some breweries adjust the color slightly with a bit of roasted malt. German lager yeast. German or Czech hops.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a Märzen with but with a balanced, sweet, smoky aroma and flavor and a somewhat darker color.</comparison>

        <name>Dunkles Bock</name>
        <impression>A dark, strong, malty German lager beer that emphasizes the malty-rich and somewhat toasty qualities of continental malts without being sweet in the finish.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium to medium-high bready-malty-rich aroma, often with moderate amounts of rich Maillard products and/or toasty overtones. Virtually no hop aroma. Some alcohol may be noticeable. Clean lager character, although the malts can provide a slight (low to none) dark fruit character, particularly in aged examples.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light copper to brown color, often with attractive garnet highlights. Lagering should provide good clarity despite the dark color. Large, creamy, persistent, off-white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Complex, rich maltiness is dominated by the toasty-rich Maillard products. Some caramel notes may be present. Hop bitterness is generally only high enough to support the malt flavors, allowing a bit of sweetness to linger into the finish. Well-attenuated, not cloying. Clean fermentation profile, although the malt can provide a slight dark fruit character. No hop flavor. No roasted or burnt character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full bodied. Moderate to moderately low carbonation. Some alcohol warmth may be found, but should never be hot. Smooth, without harshness or astringency.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Decoction mashing and long boiling plays an important part of flavor development, as it enhances the caramel and Maillard flavor aspects of the malt. Any fruitiness is due to Munich and other specialty malts, not yeast-derived esters developed during fermentation.</comments>
        <history>Originated in the Northern German city of Einbeck, which was a brewing center and popular exporter in the days of the Hanseatic League (14th to 17th century). Recreated in Munich starting in the 17th century. The name “bock” is based on a corruption of the name “Einbeck” in the Bavarian dialect, and was thus only used after the beer came to Munich. “Bock” also means “Ram” in German, and is often used in logos and advertisements.</history>
        <ingredients>Munich and Vienna malts, rarely a tiny bit of dark roasted malts for color adjustment, never any non-malt adjuncts. Continental European hop varieties are used. Clean German lager yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Darker, with a richer malty flavor and less apparent bitterness than a Helles Bock. Less alcohol and malty richness than a Doppelbock. Stronger malt flavors and higher alcohol than a Märzen. Richer, less attenuated, and less hoppy than a Czech Amber Lager.</comparison>

        <name>Vienna Lager</name>
        <impression>A moderate-strength amber lager with a soft, smooth maltiness and moderate bitterness, yet finishing relatively dry. The malt flavor is clean, bready-rich, and somewhat toasty, with an elegant impression derived from quality base malts and process, not specialty malts and adjuncts.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderately-intense malt aroma, with toasty and malty-rich aromatics. Clean lager character. Floral, spicy hop aroma may be low to none. A significant caramel or roasted aroma is inappropriate.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light reddish amber to copper color. Bright clarity. Large, off-white, persistent head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Soft, elegant malt complexity is in the forefront, with a firm enough hop bitterness to provide a balanced finish. The malt flavor tends towards a rich, toasty character, without significant caramel or roast flavors. Fairly dry, crisp finish, with both rich malt and hop bitterness present in the aftertaste. Floral, spicy hop flavor may be low to none. Clean lager fermentation character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, with a gentle creaminess. Moderate carbonation. Smooth.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A standard-strength everyday beer, not a beer brewed for festivals. American versions can be a bit stronger, drier and more bitter, while modern European versions tend to be sweeter. Many Mexican amber and dark lagers used to be more authentic, but unfortunately are now more like sweet, adjunct-laden Amber/Dark International Lagers. Regrettably, many modern examples use adjuncts which lessen the rich malt complexity characteristic of the best examples of this style. This style is on the watch list to move to the Historical category in future guidelines; that would allow the classic style to be described while moving the sweeter modern versions to the International Amber or Dark Lager styles.</comments>
        <history>Developed by Anton Dreher in Vienna in 1841, became popular in the mid-late 1800s. Now nearly extinct in its area of origin, the style continues in Mexico where it was brought by Santiago Graf and other Austrian immigrant brewers in the late 1800s. Authentic examples are increasingly hard to find (except perhaps in the craft beer industry) as formerly good examples become sweeter and use more adjuncts.</history>
        <ingredients>Vienna malt provides a lightly toasty and complex, Maillard-rich malt profile. As with Märzens, only the finest quality malt should be used, along with Continental hops (preferably Saazer types or Styrians). Can use some caramel malts and/or darker malts to add color and sweetness, but caramel malts shouldn’t add significant aroma and flavor and dark malts shouldn’t provide any roasted character.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Lighter malt character, slightly less body, and slightly more bitter in the balance than a Märzen, yet with many of the same malt-derived flavors. The malt character is similar to a Märzen, but less intense and more balanced. Lower in alcohol than Märzen or Festbier. Less rich, less malty and less hop-centered compared to Czech Amber Lager.</comparison>

        <name>Altbier</name>
        <impression>A well-balanced, well-attenuated, bitter yet malty, clean, and smooth, amber- to copper-colored German beer. The bitterness is balanced by the malt richness, but the malt intensity and character can range from moderate to high (the bitterness increases with the malt richness).</impression>
        <aroma>Clean yet robust and complex aroma of grainy-rich malt and spicy hops with restrained (low to medium-low) fruity esters. The malt character reflects German base malt varieties, with rich baked bread and nutty-toasty bread crust notes. The hop aroma may vary from moderate to low, and can have a peppery, spicy, floral, herbal or perfumy character associated with Saazer-type hops.</aroma>
        <appearance>The color ranges from light amber to deep copper color, stopping short of brown; bronze-orange is most common. Brilliant clarity. Thick, creamy, long-lasting off-white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Assertive hop bitterness well balanced by a sturdy yet clean and crisp malt character. The malt presence is moderated by medium-high to high attenuation, but considerable rich, complex, and somewhat grainy malt flavors can remain. Some fruity esters (especially cherry-like) may survive the lagering period. A long-lasting, medium-dry to dry, bittersweet or nutty finish reflects both the hop bitterness and malt complexity. Spicy, peppery or floral hop flavor can be moderate to low. No roasted malt flavors or harshness. The apparent bitterness level is sometimes masked by the malt character; the bitterness can seem as low as moderate if the finish is not very dry. Light sulfury or minerally character optional.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-bodied. Smooth. Medium to medium-high carbonation, although can be lower when served from the cask. Astringency low to none. Despite being very full of flavor, is light-bodied enough to be consumed as a gravity-fed session beer in its home brewpubs in Düsseldorf.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A top-fermented lagered beer, fermented at cool ale temperature (59-68 °F), often conditioned at bottom-fermentation temperatures (about 50 °F) and then lagered at cold temperatures to produce a cleaner, smoother palate than is typical for most ales. Zum Uerige is a wonderful beer, but much more aggressively bitter and complex than most other German examples. It may be like the Fuller’s ESB of the strong bitter category - well-known but somewhat of a stylistic outlier. Do not judge all Altbiers as if they were Zum Uerige clones; allow for a more balanced bitterness in the beer (25-35 IBUs is more typical for most other German examples). Stronger <em>sticke</em> and <em>doppelsticke</em> beers should not be entered here.</comments>
        <history>The traditional style of beer from Düsseldorf. “Alt” refers to the “old” style of brewing (i.e., using top-fermenting yeast) that was common before bottom-fermenting lager brewing became popular. Predates the isolation of bottom-fermenting yeast strains, though it approximates many characteristics of bottom-fermenting lager beers. Many of the classic examples can be found in brewpubs in the Altstadt (“old town”) section of Düsseldorf.</history>
        <ingredients>Grists vary, but usually consist of German base malts (usually Pils, sometimes Munich) with small amounts of crystal, chocolate, and/or black malts used to adjust color. Occasionally will include some wheat, including roasted wheat. Spalt hops are traditional, but other Saazer-type hops can also be used. Clean, highly attenuative ale yeast. A step mash or decoction mash program is traditional.</ingredients>
        <comparison>More bitter and malty than international amber lagers. Somewhat similar to California Common, both in production technique and finished flavor and color, though not in ingredients.</comparison>

        <comments>Young, unfiltered, unpasteurized versions of the traditional German beer styles, traditionally served on tap from the lagering vessel. The name literally means “cellar beer” - implying a beer served straight from the lagering cellar. Since this serving method can be applied to a wide range of beers, the style is somewhat hard to pin down. However, there are several common variants that can be described and used as templates for other versions. Sometimes described as <em>Naturtrüb</em> or naturally cloudy. Also sometimes called <em>Zwickelbier</em>, after the name of the tap used to sample from a lagering tank.</comments>
        <history>Originally, Kellerbier referred to any Lager beer being matured in the caves or cellars under the brewery. In the 19th century, Kellerbier was a strong, aged beer meant to last the summer (Sommerbier), stored in rock cellars and served straight from them. But when refrigeration began to be used, the term shifted to describing special beers that were served young, directly from the cellar or lagering vessel. Today some breweries use the term purely for marketing purposes to make their beers appear special. While a kellerbier is sometimes considered more of a serving style than a beer style, the serving technique is still predominately used with certain styles in certain regions (such as Helles around the Munich area, or a Märzen in the Franconia region).</history>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify whether the entry is a <em>Pale Kellerbier</em> (based on Helles) or an <em>Amber Kellerbier</em> (based on Märzen). The entrant may specify another type of Kellerbier based on other base styles such as Pils, Bock, Schwarzbier, but should supply a style description for judges.</entryinstructions>

        <name>Kellerbier: Pale Kellerbier</name>
        <notes>A very common seasonal summer beer brewed by many of the Munich area breweries and served in the beer gardens, where they are very popular.</notes>
        <impression>A young, fresh Helles, so while still a malty, fully-attenuated Pils malt showcase, the hop character (aroma, flavor and bitterness) is more pronounced, and the beer is cloudy, often with some level of diacetyl, and possibly has some green apple and/or other yeast-derived notes. As with the traditional Helles, the Keller version is still a beer intended to be drunk by the liter, so overall it should remain a light, refreshing, easy drinking golden lager.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderately-low to moderately-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma. Very low to moderate diacetyl, possible very low green apple or other yeast derived notes. Pleasantly grainy-sweet, clean malt aroma, with possible low background note of DMS.</aroma>
        <appearance>Slight haze to moderately cloudy, but never extremely cloudy or murky. Medium yellow to pale gold color. Creamy white head with good persistence. When served on cask, can have low carbonation and very low head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately malty with a rounded, grainy-sweet profile. Low to moderately-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor, with a moderate hop bitterness that can linger. Finish is crisp and dry, but the aftertaste remains malty. Very low to moderate diacetyl, which should always remain at a pleasant, drinkable level that balances somewhat with the other characteristics of the beer; overwhelming diacetyl is not appropriate. Possible very low green apple or other yeast derived notes, and possible low background note of DMS.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body. Low to medium carbonation. Depending on the level of yeast in suspension, it may assist in creating a slightly creamy texture. A slight slickness on the tongue may be present from the diacetyl.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most Pale Kellerbiers are young, unfiltered, unpasteurized versions of Munich Helles beer, although Pils or a different, custom golden lager beer designed specifically for serving young could also be used. The best examples are served only on tap at many of the Munich area breweries. Bottled versions are not likely to have the freshness, hop character and young beer notes exhibited by the draft versions.</comments>
        <history>Modern adaptation from the traditional Franconian style, using Helles instead of Märzen. Today, a popular summer seasonal beer.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner malt, German hops, German lager yeast; same as a Munich Helles.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Most commonly, a young, unfiltered and unpasteurized version of a Munich Helles, though it can be a young, unfiltered and unpasteurized version of other golden German lagers, such as a Pilsner or a seasonal golden lager made specifically for serving young.</comparison>

        <name>Kellerbier: Amber Kellerbier</name>
        <notes>The original style of Kellerbier from the Franconia area of Germany. A much older style compared to the relatively more recent pale Helles-Style Kellerbier that is popular in the Munich area today.</notes>
        <impression>A young, unfiltered, and unpasteurized beer that is between a Helles and Märzen in color, spicier in the hops with greater attenuation. Interpretations range in color and balance, but remain in the drinkable 4.8% ABV neighborhood. Balance ranges from the dry, spicy and pale-colored interpretations by St. Georgen and Löwenbräu of Buttenheim, to darker and maltier interpretations in the Fränkische Schweiz. This style is above all a method of producing simple drinkable beers for neighbors out of local ingredients to be served fresh. Balance with a focus on drinkability and digestibility is important.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate intensity of German malt, typically rich, bready, somewhat toasty, with light bread crust notes. Moderately-low to moderate spicy peppery hop aroma. Very low to low diacetyl, occasionally low to moderately-low sulfur and very low green apple or other yeast-derived notes. Caramel, biscuity, or roasted malt aroma is inappropriate.</aroma>
        <appearance>Moderately cloudy to clear depending on age, but never extremely cloudy or murky. Gold to deep reddish-amber color. Off-white, creamy head. When served on cask, can have low carbonation and very low head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Initial malt flavor may suggest sweetness, but finish is moderately dry to dry, and slightly bitter. Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready-toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately high, and spicy or herbal hop flavor is low to moderately high. Balance can be either on the malt or hop side, but the finish is not sweet. Noticeable caramel or roasted malt flavors are inappropriate. Very low to low diacetyl. Possible very low green apple or other yeast-derived notes. Smooth, malty aftertaste.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body, with a creamy texture and medium carbonation. Fully fermented, without a sweet or cloying impression.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The best examples of Amber Kellerbier are served only on tap at many of the small Franconia area breweries (as this is a beer best served fresh and the serving style being an important part of the style). Bottled versions are not likely to have the freshness, hop character and young beer notes exhibited by the draft versions.</comments>
        <history>This was the classic, historical style before it was adapted in other areas. This original, older style of Kellerbier would have simply been beer served from local taverns that did not lager long enough to drop bright. Many breweries in Franconia would use some of this young beer during the summer months, for festivals such as the Annafest (est. 1840) in July in Forchheim, where it was traditional to drink directly from the lagering vessels.</history>
        <ingredients>Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasized Franconian pale and color malt. The notion of elegance is derived from the high-quality local ingredients, particularly the malts. Spalt or other typically spicy local hops are most common. Frugal Franconian brewers rarely used decoction brewing due to the cost of energy.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Most commonly, this style is a young, unfiltered, unpasteurized, hoppier version of Munich Helles or Märzen. Fränkische Schweiz versions can edge up to dark amber or brown.</comparison>

        <name>Munich Dunkel</name>
        <impression>Characterized by depth, richness and complexity typical of darker Munich malts with the accompanying Maillard products. Deeply bready-toasty, often with chocolate-like flavors in the freshest examples, but never harsh, roasty, or astringent; a decidedly malt-balanced beer, yet still easily drinkable.</impression>
        <aroma>Rich, elegant, deep malt sweetness, typically like bread crusts (often toasted bread crusts). Hints of chocolate, nuts, caramel, and/or toffee are also acceptable, with fresh traditional versions often showing higher levels of chocolate. Clean fermentation profile. A slight spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is acceptable.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep copper to dark brown, often with a red or garnet tint. Creamy, light to medium tan head. Usually clear, although murky unfiltered versions exist.</appearance>
        <flavor>Dominated by the soft, rich, and complex flavor of darker Munich malts, usually with overtones reminiscent of toasted bread crusts, but without a burnt-harsh-grainy toastiness. The palate can be moderately malty, although it should not be overwhelming or cloyingly sweet. Mild caramel, toast or nuttiness may be present. Very fresh examples often have a pleasant malty-chocolate character that isn’t roasty or sweet. Burnt or bitter flavors from roasted malts are inappropriate, as are pronounced caramel flavors from crystal malt. Hop bitterness is moderately low but perceptible, with the balance tipped firmly towards maltiness. Hop flavor is low to none; if noted, should reflect floral, spicy, or herbal German-type varieties. Aftertaste remains malty, although the hop bitterness may become more apparent in the medium-dry finish. Clean fermentation profile and lager character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full body, providing a soft and dextrinous mouthfeel without being heavy or cloying. Moderate carbonation. The use of continental Munich-type malts should provide a richness, not a harsh or biting astringency.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Unfiltered versions from Germany can taste like liquid bread, with a yeasty, earthy richness not found in exported filtered examples.</comments>
        <history>The classic brown lager style of Munich which developed as a darker, more malt-accented beer than other regional lagers. While originating in Munich, the style became popular throughout Bavaria (especially Franconia). Franconian versions are often darker and more bitter.</history>
        <ingredients>Grist is traditionally made up of German Munich malt (up to 100% in some cases) with the remainder German Pilsner malt. Small amounts of crystal malt can add dextrins and color but should not introduce excessive residual sweetness. Slight additions of roasted malts (such as Carafa or chocolate) may be used to improve color but should not add strong flavors. Traditional German hop varieties and German lager yeast strains should be used. Often decoction mashed (up to a triple decoction) to enhance the malt flavors and create the depth of color.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Not as intense in maltiness as a bock (and thus more drinkable in quantity). Lacking the more roasted flavors (and often hop bitterness) of a schwarzbier. Richer, more malt-centric, and less hoppy than a Czech Dark Lager.</comparison>

        <name>Schwarzbier</name>
        <impression>A dark German lager that balances roasted yet smooth malt flavors with moderate hop bitterness. The lighter body, dryness, and lack of a harsh, burnt, or heavy aftertaste helps make this beer quite drinkable.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to moderate malt, with low aromatic malty sweetness and/or hints of roast malt often apparent. The malt can be clean and neutral or moderately rich and bready, and may have a hint of dark caramel. The roast character can be somewhat dark chocolate- or coffee-like but should never be burnt. A low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is optional. Clean lager yeast character, although a light sulfur is possible.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium to very dark brown in color, often with deep ruby to garnet highlights, yet almost never truly black. Very clear. Large, persistent, tan-colored head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Light to moderate malt flavor, which can have a clean, neutral character to a moderately rich, bread-malty quality. Light to moderate roasted malt flavors can give a bitter-chocolate palate that lasts into the finish, but which are never burnt. Medium-low to medium bitterness, which can last into the finish. Light to moderate spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor. Clean lager character. Aftertaste tends to dry out slowly and linger, featuring hop bitterness with a complementary but subtle roastiness in the background. Some residual sweetness is acceptable but not required.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation. Smooth. No harshness or astringency, despite the use of dark, roasted malts.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Literally means “black beer” in German. While sometimes called a “black Pils,” the beer is rarely as dark as black or as bitter as a Pils; don’t expect strongly roasted, porter-like flavors.</comments>
        <history>A regional specialty from Thuringia, Saxony and Franconia in Germany. History is a bit sketchy, but is suspected of being originally a top-fermented beer. Popularity grew after German reunification. Served as the inspiration for black lagers brewed in Japan.</history>
        <ingredients>German Munich malt and/or Pilsner malts for the base, supplemented by a judicious use of roasted malts (such as Carafa types) for the dark color and subtle roast flavors. Huskless dark roasted malts can add roast flavors without burnt flavors. German hop varieties and clean German lager yeasts are traditional.</ingredients>
        <comparison>In comparison with a Munich Dunkel, usually darker in color, drier on the palate, lighter in body, and with a noticeable (but not high) roasted malt edge to balance the malt base. Should not taste like an American Porter made with lager yeast. Drier, less malty, with less hop character than a Czech Dark Lager.</comparison>

        <name>Doppelbock</name>
        <impression>A strong, rich, and very malty German lager that can have both pale and dark variants. The darker versions have more richly-developed, deeper malt flavors, while the paler versions have slightly more hops and dryness.</impression>
        <aroma>Very strong maltiness. Darker versions will have significant Maillard products and often some toasty aromas. A light caramel aroma is acceptable. Lighter versions will have a strong malt presence with some Maillard products and toasty notes. Virtually no hop aroma, although a light noble hop aroma is acceptable in pale versions. A moderately low malt-derived dark fruit character may be present (but is optional) in dark versions. A very slight chocolate-like aroma may be present in darker versions, but no roasted or burned aromatics should ever be present. Moderate alcohol aroma may be present.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep gold to dark brown in color. Darker versions often have ruby highlights. Lagering should provide good clarity. Large, creamy, persistent head (color varies with base style: white for pale versions, off-white for dark varieties). Stronger versions might have impaired head retention, and can display noticeable legs.</appearance>
        <flavor>Very rich and malty. Darker versions will have significant Maillard products and often some toasty flavors. Lighter versions will have a strong malt flavor with some Maillard products and toasty notes. A very slight chocolate flavor is optional in darker versions, but should never be perceived as roasty or burnt. Clean lager character. A moderately low malt-derived dark fruit character is optional in darker versions. Invariably there will be an impression of alcoholic strength, but this should be smooth and warming rather than harsh or burning. Little to no hop flavor (more is acceptable in pale versions). Hop bitterness varies from moderate to moderately low but always allows malt to dominate the flavor. Most versions are fairly malty-sweet, but should have an impression of attenuation. The sweetness comes from low hopping, not from incomplete fermentation. Paler versions generally have a drier finish.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-full to full body. Moderate to moderately-low carbonation. Very smooth without harshness, astringency. A light alcohol warmth may be noted, but it should never burn.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most versions are dark colored and may display the caramelizing and Maillard products of decoction mashing, but excellent pale versions also exist. The pale versions will not have the same richness and darker malt flavors of the dark versions, and may be a bit drier, hoppier and more bitter. While most traditional examples are in the lower end of the ranges cited, the style can be considered to have no upper limit for gravity, alcohol and bitterness (thus providing a home for very strong lagers).</comments>
        <history>A Bavarian specialty first brewed in Munich by the monks of St. Francis of Paula. Historical versions were less well-attenuated than modern interpretations, with consequently higher sweetness and lower alcohol levels (and hence was considered “liquid bread” by the monks). The term “doppel (double) bock” was coined by Munich consumers. Many commercial doppelbocks have names ending in “-ator,” either as a tribute to the prototypical Salvator or to take advantage of the beer’s popularity. Traditionally dark brown in color; paler examples are a more recent development.</history>
        <ingredients>Pils and/or Vienna malt for pale versions (with some Munich), Munich and Vienna malts for darker ones and occasionally a tiny bit of darker color malts (such as Carafa). Saazer-type hops. Clean lager yeast. Decoction mashing is traditional.</ingredients>
        <comparison>A stronger, richer, more full-bodied version of either a Dunkles Bock or a Helles Bock. Pale versions will show higher attenuation and less dark fruity character than the darker versions.</comparison>

        <impression>A strong, full-bodied, rich, and malty dark German lager often with a viscous quality and strong flavors. Even though flavors are concentrated, the alcohol should be smooth and warming, not burning.</impression>
        <aroma>Dominated by a balance of rich, intense malt and a definite alcohol presence. No hop aroma. May have significant malt-derived dark fruit esters. Alcohol aromas should not be harsh or solventy.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep copper to dark brown in color, often with attractive ruby highlights. Lagering should provide good clarity. Head retention may be moderate to poor. Off-white to deep ivory colored head. Pronounced legs are often evident.</appearance>
        <flavor>Rich, sweet malt balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The malt can have Maillard products, toasty qualities, some caramel, and occasionally a slight chocolate flavor. No hop flavor. Hop bitterness just offsets the malt sweetness enough to avoid a cloying character. May have significant malt-derived dark fruit esters. The alcohol should be smooth, not harsh or hot, and should help the hop bitterness balance the strong malt presence. The finish should be of malt and alcohol, and can have a certain dryness from the alcohol. It should not by sticky, syrupy or cloyingly sweet. Clean lager character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Full to very full-bodied. Low carbonation. Significant alcohol warmth without sharp hotness. Very smooth without harsh edges from alcohol, bitterness, fusels, or other concentrated flavors.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Extended lagering is often needed post-freezing to smooth the alcohol and enhance the malt and alcohol balance. Pronounced “ICE-bock.”</comments>

        <ingredients>Same as doppelbock. Commercial eisbocks are generally concentrated anywhere from 7% to 33% (by volume).</ingredients>
        <comparison>Eisbocks are not simply stronger doppelbocks; the name refers to the process of freezing and concentrating the beer and is <em>not</em> a statement on alcohol; some doppelbocks are stronger than Eisbocks. Not as thick, rich, or sweet as a Wheatwine.</comparison>

        <name>Baltic Porter</name>
        <impression>A Baltic Porter often has the malt flavors reminiscent of an English porter and the restrained roast of a schwarzbier, but with a higher OG and alcohol content than either. Very complex, with multi-layered malt and dark fruit flavors.</impression>
        <aroma>Rich malty sweetness often containing caramel, toffee, nutty to deep toast, and/or licorice notes. Complex alcohol and ester profile of moderate strength, and reminiscent of plums, prunes, raisins, cherries or currants, occasionally with a vinous Port-like quality. Some darker malt character that is deep chocolate, coffee or molasses but never burnt. No hops. No sourness. Very smooth.</aroma>
        <appearance>Dark reddish-copper to opaque dark brown (not black). Thick, persistent tan-colored head. Clear, although darker versions can be opaque.</appearance>
        <flavor>As with aroma, has a rich malty sweetness with a complex blend of deep malt, dried fruit esters, and alcohol. Has a prominent yet smooth schwarzbier-like roasted flavor that stops short of burnt. Mouth-filling and very smooth. Clean lager character. Starts sweet but darker malt flavors quickly dominates and persists through finish. Just a touch dry with a hint of roast coffee or licorice in the finish. Malt can have a caramel, toffee, nutty, molasses and/or licorice complexity. Light hints of black currant and dark fruits. Medium-low to medium bitterness from malt and hops, just to provide balance. Hop flavor from slightly spicy hops ranges from none to medium-low.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Generally quite full-bodied and smooth, with a well-aged alcohol warmth. Medium to medium-high carbonation, making it seem even more mouth-filling. Not heavy on the tongue due to carbonation level.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>May also be described today as an Imperial Porter, although heavily roasted or hopped versions are not appropriate for this style. Most versions are in the 7-8.5% ABV range. Danish breweries often refer to them as Stouts, which indicates their historic lineage from the days when Porter was used as a generic name for Porter and Stout.</comments>
        <history>Traditional beer from countries bordering the Baltic Sea, developed indigenously after higher-gravity export brown or imperial stouts from England were established. Historically top-fermented, many breweries adapted the recipes for bottom-fermenting yeast along with the rest of their production.</history>
        <ingredients>Generally lager yeast (cold fermented if using ale yeast, as is required when brewed in Russia). Debittered chocolate or black malt. Munich or Vienna base malt. Continental hops (Saazer-type, typically). May contain crystal malts and/or adjuncts. Brown or amber malt common in historical recipes.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Much less roasted and smoother than an Imperial Stout, typically with less alcohol. Lacks the roasty qualities of stouts in general, more taking on the roasted-but-not-burnt characteristics of a schwarzbier. Quite fruity compared to other porters. Higher alcohol than other porters.</comparison>

        <name>Weissbier</name>
        <impression>A pale, refreshing German wheat beer with high carbonation, dry finish, a fluffy mouthfeel, and a distinctive banana-and-clove yeast character.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate to strong phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (typically banana). The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. The hop character ranges from low to none. A light to moderate wheat aroma (which might be perceived as bready or grainy) may be present but other malt characteristics should not. Optional, but acceptable, aromatics can include a light to moderate vanilla character, and/or a faint bubblegum aroma. None of these optional characteristics should be high or dominant, but often can add to the complexity and balance.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale straw to gold in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting white head is characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in an unfiltered beer, although the level of haze is somewhat variable.</appearance>
        <flavor>Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally, a very light to moderate vanilla character and/or faint bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness and roundness; neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready or grainy flavor of wheat is complementary, as is a slightly grainy-sweet malt character. Hop flavor is very low to none, and hop bitterness is very low to moderately low. Well-rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish. The perception of sweetness is more due to the absence of hop bitterness than actual residual sweetness; a sweet or heavy finish would significantly impair drinkability.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Suspended yeast may increase the perception of body. The texture of wheat imparts the sensation of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a light, spritzy finish aided by high to very high carbonation. Always effervescent.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>These are refreshing, fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped and show a unique banana-and-clove yeast character. These beers often don’t age well and are best enjoyed while young and fresh. The version <em>mit hefe</em> is served with suspended yeast; the <em>krystal</em> version is filtered for excellent clarity. The character of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less phenolic than that of the weissbier mit hefe. May be known as <em>hefeweizen</em>, particularly in the United States.</comments>
        <history>While Bavaria has a wheat beer tradition dating back hundreds of years, brewing wheat beer used to be a monopoly reserved for Bavarian royalty. Modern weissbier dates from 1872 when Schneider began production. However, pale weissbier only became popular since the 1960s. It is quite popular today, particularly in southern Germany.</history>
        <ingredients>By German brewing tradition, at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat, although some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is typically Pilsner malt. A decoction mash is traditional, although modern brewers typically don’t follow this practice. Weizen ale yeast produces the typical spicy and fruity character, although high fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.</ingredients>

        <name>Dunkles Weissbier</name>
        <impression>A moderately dark German wheat beer with a distinctive banana-and-clove yeast character, supported by a toasted bread or caramel malt flavor. Highly carbonated and refreshing, with a creamy, fluffy texture and light finish that encourages drinking.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate phenols (usually clove) and fruity esters (usually banana). The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced. Optionally, a low to moderate vanilla character and/or faint bubblegum notes may be present, but should not dominate. Hop aroma ranges from low to none, and may be lightly floral, spicy, or herbal. A light to moderate wheat aroma (which might be perceived as bready, doughy or grainy) may be present and is often accompanied by a caramel, bread crust, or richer malt aroma. The malt aroma may moderate the phenols and esters somewhat.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light copper to mahogany brown in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting off-white head is characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in this traditionally unfiltered style, although the level of haze is somewhat variable. Suspended yeast sediment can contribute to cloudiness.</appearance>
        <flavor>Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor. The balance and intensity of the phenol and ester components can vary but the best examples are reasonably balanced and fairly prominent. Optionally, a very light to moderate vanilla character and/or faint bubblegum notes can accentuate the banana flavor, sweetness and roundness; neither should be dominant if present. The soft, somewhat bready, doughy, or grainy flavor of wheat is complementary, as is a richer caramel, toast, or bread crust flavor. The malty richness can be low to medium-high, and supports the yeast character. A roasted malt character is inappropriate. A spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor is very low to none, and hop bitterness is very low to low. Well-rounded, flavorful, often somewhat malty palate with a relatively dry finish.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium-full body. The texture of wheat as well as yeast in suspension imparts the sensation of a fluffy, creamy fullness that may progress to a lighter finish, aided by moderate to high carbonation. Effervescent.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The presence of Munich and/or Vienna-type barley malts gives this style a deep, rich barley malt character not found in a weissbier. Often known as <em>dunkelweizen</em>, particularly in the United States.</comments>
        <history>Bavaria has a wheat beer brewing traditional hundreds of years old, but the brewing right was reserved for Bavarian royalty until the late 1700s. Old-fashioned Bavarian wheat beer was often dark, as were most beer of the day. Pale weissbier started to become popular in the 1960s, but traditional dark wheat beer remained somewhat of an old person’s drink.</history>
        <ingredients>By German brewing tradition, at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat, although some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is usually Munich, Vienna, or dark or caramel wheat malts, or Pilsner malt with color malt. A decoction mash is traditional, but infrequently used today. Weizen ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character, although extreme fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Reflecting the best yeast and wheat character of a weissbier blended with the malty richness of a Munich dunkel. The banana and clove character is often less apparent than in a weissbier due to the increased maltiness.</comparison>

        <name>Weizenbock</name>
        <impression>A strong, malty, fruity, wheat-based ale combining the best malt and yeast flavors of a weissbier (pale or dark) with the malty-rich flavor, strength, and body of a Dunkles Bock or Doppelbock.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium-high to high malty-rich character with a significant bready-grainy wheat component. Paler versions will have a bready-toasty malty richness, while darker versions will have a deeper, richer malt presence with significant Maillard products. The malt component is similar to a helles bock for pale versions (grainy-sweet-rich, lightly toasted) or a dunkles bock for dark versions (bready-malty-rich, highly toasted, optional caramel). The yeast contributes a typical weizen character of banana and spice (clove, vanilla), which can be medium-low to medium-high. Darker versions can have some dark fruit aroma (plums, prunes, grapes, raisins), particularly as they age. A low to moderate alcohol aroma is acceptable, but shouldn’t be hot or solventy. No hop aroma. The malt, yeast, and alcohol intertwine to produce a complex, inviting, prominent bouquet.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale and dark versions exist, with pale versions being light gold to light amber, and dark versions being dark amber to dark ruby-brown in color. A very thick, moussy, long-lasting white to off-white (pale versions) or light tan (dark versions) head is characteristic. The high protein content of wheat impairs clarity in this traditionally unfiltered style, although the level of haze is somewhat variable. Suspended yeast sediment can contribute to the cloudiness.</appearance>
        <flavor>Similar to the aroma, a medium-high to high malty-rich flavor together with a significant bready-grainy wheat flavor. Paler versions will have a bready, toasty, grainy-sweet malt richness, while darker versions will have deeper, bready-rich or toasted malt flavors with significant Maillard products, optional caramel. Low to moderate banana and spice (clove, vanilla) yeast character. Darker versions can have some dark fruit flavor (plums, prunes, grapes, raisins), particularly as they age. A light chocolate character (but not roast) is optional in darker versions. No hop flavor. A low hop bitterness can give a slightly sweet palate impression, but the beer typically finishes dry (sometimes enhanced by a light alcohol character). The interplay between the malt, yeast, and alcohol adds complexity and interest, which is often enhanced with age.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-full to full body. A fluffy or creamy texture is typical, as is the mild warming sensation of substantial alcohol content. Moderate to high carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A Weissbier brewed to bock or doppelbock strength. Schneider also produces an Eisbock version. Pale and dark versions exist, although dark are more common. Pale versions have less rich malt complexity and often more hops, as with doppelbocks. Lightly oxidized Maillard products can produce some rich, intense flavors and aromas that are often seen in aged imported commercial products; fresher versions will not have this character. Well-aged examples might also take on a slight sherry-like complexity.</comments>
        <history>Aventinus, the world’s oldest top-fermented wheat doppelbock, was created in 1907 at the Schneider Weisse Brauhaus in Munich.</history>
        <ingredients>A high percentage of malted wheat is used (by German brewing tradition must be at least 50%, although it may contain up to 70%), with the remainder being Munich- and/or Vienna-type barley malts in darker versions, and more Pils malt in paler versions. Some color malts may be used sparingly. A traditional decoction mash can give the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character. Too warm or too cold fermentation will cause the phenols and esters to be out of balance and may create off-flavors. Hop choice is essentially irrelevant, but German varieties are most traditional.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Stronger and richer than a Weissbier or Dunkles Weissbier, but with similar yeast character. More directly comparable to the Doppelbock style, with the pale and dark variations. Can vary widely in strength, but most are in the bock to doppelbock range.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant will specify whether the entry is a <strong>pale</strong> or a <strong>dark</strong> version.</entryinstructions>

      <name>British Bitter</name>
      <notes>La famiglia delle Bitter britanniche ha origine dalle Pale Ale inglesi in fusto nel tardo 19° secolo. L’impiego di malti Crystal nelle Bitter si diffuse dopo la prima guerra mondiale. Tradizionalmente sono servite molto giovani senza pressione (per gravità o con pompa a mano) a temperatura di cantina (cioè “Real Ale”). La maggior parte delle Bitter prodotte nel Regno Unito in bottiglia o in fusto (keg) sono spesso versioni per l’esportazione più alcoliche e più carbonate di quelle prodotte in cask e hanno caratteristiche ed equilibrio differenti rispetto alle controparti britanniche (spesso più dolci e meno luppolate delle versioni in cask). Queste linee guida riflettono la versione “Real Ale” di questo stile e non le formulazioni per l’esportazione dei vari prodotti commerciali.</notes>
      <notes>Esistono parecchie variazioni regionali della Bitter, da versioni più scure e più dolci servite senza schiuma a versioni più chiare, più limpide e più luppolate con schiuma generosa e tutto quello che ci sta in mezzo.</notes>
      <notes>giudici non dovrebbero enfatizzare troppo il contenuto di caramello di questi stili. Le birre esportate potrebbero essere ossidate e questo aumenta la percezione del caramello (e di altri gusti negativi). Non bisogna presumere che gusti derivati dall’ossidazione siano tradizionali o richiesti nello stile.</notes>
      <subcategory id="11A">
        <name>Ordinary Bitter</name>
        <impression>Birra a bassa gravità, a basso tenore alcolico e bassa carbonazione di facile bevibilità (session beer). Il profilo del malto varia in gusto e intensità ma non dovrebbe mai coprire la caratteristica di amaro. La bevibilità è una componente base di questo stile.</impression>
        <aroma>Malto da basso a moderato con spesso (ma non sempre) aromi di lieve caramello. Comuni le note di pane, biscotto o lieve malto tostato. Fruttato da morbido a moderato e aroma di luppolo variabile da nullo a moderato, tipicamente con caratteristiche floreali, terrose, resinose e/o fruttate. In genere non è presente diacetile, anche se sono concessi livelli bassissimi.</aroma>
        <appearance>Colore da ambrato pallido a ramato chiaro, limpidezza da buona a luminosa e schiuma da bassa a moderata di color tra il bianco e il crema. La schiuma può essere scarsa per la bassa carbonazione.</appearance>
        <flavor>Amaro da medio a moderatamente elevato. Esteri fruttati da moderatamente bassi a moderatamente alti con luppolo tipicamente terroso, resinoso, fruttato e/o floreale. La maltosità va da bassa a media con finale secco. Il profilo del malto è tipicamente di pane, biscotto e leggermente tostato. Gusti di caramello o toffee da bassi a moderati sono opzionali. L’equilibrio è decisamente sull’amaro anche se l’amaro non dovrebbe coprire completamente il malto, gli esteri e il luppolo. In genere non è presente diacetile, anche se sono concessi livelli bassissimi.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Corpo da leggero a medio-leggero; bassa carbonazione, anche se gli esempi in bottiglia possono essere mediamente carbonati.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>La birra a più bassa gravità nella famiglia delle Bitter britanniche, nota ai consumatori semplicemente come “Bitter” anche se i produttori la chiamano di solito Ordinary Bitter per distinguerla dalle altre birre della famiglia.</comments>
        <history>Si vedano i commenti nell'introduzione della categoria.</history>
        <ingredients>Malti Pale, Amber e/o Crystal con forse una punta di malto Dark per aggiustare il colore. Si possono aggiungere zucchero, mais o frumento. Tradizionali i luppoli da aroma inglesi, ma qualsiasi luppolo è accettabile; se si usano quelli americani, devono essere impiegati con parsimonia. Caratteristico lievito britannico.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Alcune varianti moderne sono prodotte esclusivamente con malto Pale e si chiamano Golden Ale, Summer Ale o Golden Bitter. Qui l’accento è sull’aggiunta di luppolo da amaro in contrasto con le ale americane che hanno luppolature aggressive nelle aggiunte intermedie e finali.</comparison>

Gusto di luppolo da moderato a moderatamente alto con caratteristiche	floreali, terrose, resinose e/o fruttate. Si notano l’amaro e la luppolatura ma non devono dominare del tutto	sul malto.

        <comments>Oggi in Inghilterra la ESB è la portabandiera della Fullers e nessuno la considera uno stile. Una	birra unica (ma ben conosciuta) che ha un forte e complesso profilo di malto, non riscontrabile in altri esempi	e che spesso porta i giudici a penalizzare eccessivamente le Strong Bitter inglesi tradizionali. in America il	nome è stato utilizzato per descrivere birre di alcol standard (per gli americani), maltose, amare, rossicce ale	di tipo britannico ed è inoltre uno stile molto popolare per le birre artigianali. Per questo i giudici potrebbero	pensare che la ESB americana da brewpub sia rappresentativa dello stile.</comments>

Tradizionali i luppoli da aroma inglesi, ma qualsiasi luppolo	è accettabile; se si usano quelli americani, devono essere impiegati con parsimonia. Caratteristico lievito	britannico. Le versioni Burton usano acqua con solfati da medi ad alti: questi aumentano la percezione di	secco e aggiungono un aroma e gusto minerali o sulfurei.</ingredients>
        <history>vedasi l’introduzione più sopra. Si possono considerare le Strong Bitter come una versione più	alcolica delle Best Bitter anche se non necessariamente “più premium” poiché le Best Bitter sono	tradizionalmente considerate il miglior prodotto del birraio. Le Pale Ale britanniche (ESB) sono considerate	birre amare, pallide “premium” ad alcolicità da esportazione che si avvicinano alle Strong Bitter, anche se	sono riformulate per l’imbottigliamento (compresi i maggiori livelli di carbonazione). Mentre la moderna	British Pale Ale è considerata una Bitter imbottigliata, storicamente gli stili erano differenti.</history>
        <comparison>gusti di malto e luppolo più evidenti che nelle Special o Best Bitter, e anche più alcol. Le	versioni più forti sono in qualche modo sovrapponibili con le British Strong Ale, anche se le Strong Bitter	tendono ad essere più chiare e più amare.

        <aroma>luppolo da moderatamente basso a moderatamente alto. Qualsiasi varietà di luppolo può essere impiegata: quelli inglesi floreali, erbacei o terrosi e gli agrumati americani sono i più comuni. Spesso viene utilizzata una varietà singola di luppolo.

        <flavor>amaro da medio a medio-alto con gusto di luppolo da moderato a moderatamente alto (di qualsiasi varietà, anche se i gusti agrumati sono sempre più comuni). Maltosità da bassa a medio-bassa, con gusto di pane e forse lieve biscotto. Tipicamente assenti i gusti di caramello e diacetile da basso a nullo. L’amaro e il gusto di luppolo devono essere ben pronunciati. Esteri da bassi a moderatamente bassi. Finale da mediosecco a secco.

        <comments>birra dissetante e ben luppolata con l’accento sul luppolo. Si serve più fredda delle Bitter tradizionali; in origine era pensata come una rinfrescante birra estiva ma ora è prodotta tutto l’anno. Prima si impiegavano luppoli inglesi ma ora si utilizzano sempre di più luppoli americani agrumati. Le Golden Ale sono anche chiamate Golden Bitter, Summer Ale o British Blonde Ale e si possono trovare in cask, in fusto e in bottiglia.</comments>
        <history>le moderne Golden Ale furono prodotte in Inghilterra per battere la concorrenza delle Lager. È difficile identificare quale fu la prima, ma molti ritengono che ad aprire la strada fu la Hop Back's Summer Lightning prodotta nel 1986.</history>

Di frequente si usano luppoli inglesi, anche se stanno diventando sempre più comuni le varietà americane agrumate. Lievito britannico con fermentazione pulita.</ingredients>
        <comparison>la più simile alle American Pale Ale anche se ha meno alcol e utilizza ingredienti britannici. Non ha caramello e meno esteri rispetto alle Bitter britanniche o alle Pale Ale. Secca come le Bitter ma meno maltosità a sostenere il luppolo, che impartisce quindi un diverso equilibrio. Si usano più spesso (e fanno bella mostra) luppoli americani rispetto ad altri stili moderni britannici.</comparison>

        <impression>delicata e bilanciata, tutti i componenti si fondono assieme con intensità simile. I gusti moderati mettono in mostra gli ingredienti australiani. Ampia diversificazione dei gusti, molto beverina e adatta al clima caldo. Si basa sulle caratteristiche del lievito.</impression>
        <aroma>pulito e alquanto delicato con un mix equilibrato di esteri, luppolo, malto e lievito: tutti da basso a moderato. Gli esteri sono spesso di pera o mela e forse con una lieve nota di banana (opzionale). I luppoli sono terrosi, erbacei o potrebbero evidenziare la caratteristica ferrosità del Pride of Ringwood. La maltosità varia da cereale neutro a moderatamente dolce o lieve pane; nessun caramello evidente. I prodotti molto giovani possono avere sottili aromi di lievito o sulfurei.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da giallo intenso ad ambrato chiaro ma spesso giallo medio. Schiuma bianca ampia, persistente e pannosa con bollicine piccolissime. Effervescenza percepibile per l’alta carbonazione. Limpidezza brillante se viene decantata, ma di solito si versa col lievito per dare un aspetto torbido. Normalmente non torbida a meno che non si porti il lievito in sospensione versandola.</appearance>
        <flavor>rotondo di malto, cereale o pane da basso a medio, inizialmente lieve maltato-dolce per poi evidenziare l’amaro da medio a medio-alto che controbilancia la maltosità. Di solito assenti i gusti del caramello. Birra estremamente attenuata dal finale secco con l’amaro che persiste, anche se il corpo suggerisce pienezza. Gusti di luppolo da medio a medio-alti un po’ terrosi, forse erbacei, resinosi, pepati o ferrosi ma non floreali e che permangono nel retrogusto. Esteri da medio-bassi a medio-alti, spesso di pera o mela e con banana opzionale ma mai dominante. Può essere leggermente minerale o sulfurea se è presente il lievito. Non deve mai essere anonima.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>carbonazione da alta ad elevata che riempie la bocca di bollicine con pizzicore caratteristico. Corpo da medio a medio-pieno e tendente al pieno se si versa col lievito. Delicata ma gassata. Le versioni più alcoliche possono dare leggera sensazione di calore. Birra molto ben attenuata che non dovrebbe avere nessuna dolcezza residua.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>la Coopers produce la sua birra ammiraglia, la Sparkling Ale fin dal 1862, anche se nel corso degli anni è cambiata la formulazione. Attualmente la birra ha una limpidezza brillante se è decantata, ma i baristi spesso versano gran parte della birra nel bicchiere poi girano la bottiglia e inseriscono tutto il lievito. In alcuni bar la bottiglia viene fatta rotolare lungo il banco! Quando è servita alla spina, la birreria istruisce i gestori a rovesciare il fusto per smuovere il lievito. I consumatori moderni sembrano preferirla torbida. È sempre carbonata naturalmente, anche nel fusto. Ale quotidiana ma che si beve meglio giovane.</comments>
        <history>gli archivi delle birrerie mostrano che la maggioranza delle birre australiane prodotte nel 19° secolo erano la XXX (Mild) alla spina e la Porter. La ale in bottiglia fu prodotta per fare concorrenza alle Pale Ale in bottiglia importate dall’Inghilterra, come la Bass e la Wm Younger’s Monk. Ai primi del 20° secolo la Pale Ale in bottiglia uscì di fuori moda e divennero di tendenza le lager “più leggere”. Molte Sparkling Ale e Pale Ale australiane furono etichettate come Ale, ma in realtà erano lager a bassa fermentazione con malti simili a quelli impiegati prima per le Ale. La Coopers di Adelaide è l’unica fabbrica rimasta a produrre lo stile Sparkling Ale.</history>
        <ingredients>malto Pale distico australiano poco tostato ma si possono usare varietà lager e piccole quantità di Crystal solo per aggiustare il colore. Gli esempi moderni non prevedono aggiunte ma solo zucchero di canna per il priming. Gli esempi storici usavano malto distico al 45%, malto esastico più proteico al 30% e zucchero al 25% per diluire il contenuto di azoto. Tradizionalmente luppoli australiani come il Cluster e Goldings, sostituiti da metà anni ’60 dal Pride of Ringwood. Lievito tipo Burton molto attenuante (tipicamente ceppo australiano). Profilo dell’acqua variabile, ma di solito con pochi carbonati e solfati moderati.</ingredients>
        <comparison>apparentemente simile alle Pale Ale britannica, anche se molto più carbonata, con meno caramello e meno luppolatura finale. Mette in mostra il ceppo di lievito e le varietà di luppolo impiegate. Più amara di quanto le IBU facciano intendere a causa dell’alta attenuazione e della bassa gravità finale e per i luppoli abbastanza “ruvidi”.</comparison>

        <impression>una Pale Ale britannica luppolata, moderatamente forte molto ben attenuata con finale secco, con aroma e gusto di luppolo. I classici ingredienti britannici forniscono il miglior profilo gustativo.</impression>
        <aroma>tipico aroma di luppolo floreale, speziato-pepato o di agrume-arancia naturale da moderato a moderatamente alto. Un aroma erbaceo da dry-hopping è accettabile ma non necessario. La presenza di aromi di malto moderatamente bassi che ricordano il caramello o il tostato sono opzionali e un fruttato da basso a moderato è accettabile. Alcune versioni possono avere una nota sulfurea, anche se non è obbligatoria.</aroma>
        <appearance>il colore varia da dorato ad ambrato intenso ma la maggior parte è abbastanza chiara. Dovrebbe essere limpida anche se le versioni non filtrate con dry-hopping possono essere un poco torbide. Schiuma di dimensioni ridotte, persistente e di color crema.</appearance>
        <flavor>luppolo da medio ad alto con amaro da moderato a dominante. Il gusto del luppolo dovrebbe essere simile all’aroma (floreale, speziato-pepato, agrume-arancia e/o leggermente erbaceo). Il malto dovrebbe essere da medio-basso a medio e talvolta con gusto di pane, con lievi caratteristiche di biscotto, di tostato, toffee e/o caramello. Fruttato da medio-basso a medio con finale da medio-secco a molto secco e amaro che persiste nel retrogusto senza asprezza. L’equilibrio pende verso il luppolo ma il malto deve essere distinguibile come supporto. Se si usa acqua con molti solfati sono solitamente presenti zolfo, un finale secco e minerale con amaro che perdura. Nelle versioni più alcoliche si può percepire un gusto di alcol pulito. Il barricato (quercia) non è appropriato per questo stile.</flavor>

        <comments>le caratteristiche delle IPA importanti per il loro arrivo in buone condizioni in India erano l’elevata attenuazione e la forte luppolatura. Dal momento che le IPA venivano trasportate con questa modalità, non significa che altre birre come le Porter non fossero mandate in India, o che le IPA fossero state inventate per essere mandate in India, o che le IPA fossero più luppolate di altre birre in fusto, o che il livello di alcool fosse inusuale per il tempo. Molte birre moderne etichettate come IPA sono abbastanza deboli in alcool. Secondo il CAMRA “le cosiddette IPA di circa 3.5% ABV non sono vere IPA aderenti allo stile”. Lo storico inglese della birra Martyn Cornell ha affermato che birre del genere “non sono in realtà distinguibili dalla Bitter ordinaria”. Quindi abbiamo scelto di concordare con questi autori per le nostre linee guida piuttosto che con ciò che alcuni moderni birrifici britannici chiamano IPA; ci si ricordi quindi di queste due tipologie di IPA presenti oggi sul mercato britannico.</comments>
        <history>ci sono vari resoconti sulla sua origine, ma la maggior parte degli storici concorda che quella che in seguito si sarebbe chiamata IPA era una Pale Ale preparata per essere spedita in India a fine ‘700 - primi ‘800. George Hodgson della Bow Brewery divenne un famoso esportatore di IPA ai primi ‘800 ed è il primo nome legato alla popolarità della IPA. Come per tutte le birre inglesi con una lunga storia, anche per la IPA la popolarità e la formulazione cambiarono con gli anni. Le birrerie di Burton-on-Trent con le loro acque altamente sulfuree furono in grado di produrre IPA di successo e dominarono il mercato a partire dal decennio 1830, cioè da quando si iniziò ad usare il nome IPA. Col tempo il grado alcolico e la popolarità declinarono e lo stile virtualmente sparì dal mercato nella seconda metà del 20° secolo. Si usava il nome IPA per indicare le Pale Ale e le Bitter senza particolari caratteristiche (trend che continua ancora adesso in alcuni esempi britannici moderni). Lo stile fu riscoperto dai birrifici artigianali negli anni ’80 ed è quello descritto qui. Gli esempi moderni sono ispirati dalle versioni classiche, ma non si deve pensare che abbiano un legame con quelle del passato o che abbiano lo stesso preciso profilo gustativo. White Shield è probabilmente l’esempio più antico che risale alle forti IPA di Burton, prodotta per la prima volta nel 1829.</history>

      <notes>Anche se Dark Mild, Brown Ale e le Porter inglesi hanno una lunga e leggendaria storia, queste linee guida descrivono solo le versioni moderne. Sono raggruppate assieme per il solo scopo di essere iscritte e giudicate ai concorsi dal momento che hanno spesso gusto ed equilibrio simili e non perché abbiano un passato comune. Le caratteristiche simili sono forza da bassa a moderata, colore scuro, generalmente un equilibrio verso il malto e trascorsi britannici. Questi stili non hanno avuto relazioni storiche; soprattutto, nessuno di questi stili è evoluto verso un altro o ne è stato una componente. Il nome della categoria non è mai stato storicamente utilizzato per descrivere questo gruppo di birre: è il nostro nome per la categoria di concorsi. Brown Beer è stato un distinto e importante prodotto storico e non ha nessuna relazione con il nome di questa categoria.</notes>

        <impression>una session-beer inglese scura, a bassa gravità, incentrata sul malto e molto adatta a essere bevuta in quantità. Rinfrescante ma molto gustosa con un’ampia gamma di sfumature del malto e dello zucchero scuro.</impression>
        <aroma>malto da basso a moderato con un po’ di fruttato. La maltosità al naso può essere descritta come caramello, toffee, cereale, tostato, frutta secca, cioccolato o appena torrefatto. Aroma di luppolo da lieve a nullo con sentori terrosi o floreali se presente. Diacetile da lieve a nullo.</aroma>
        <appearance>di colore variabile dal ramato al marrone scuro o mogano, esistono anche rari esempi più chiari da ambrato medio a marrone chiaro. È generalmente limpida, anche se tradizionalmente non è filtrata. Schiuma da color crema a marroncino da bassa a moderata ma di scarsa ritenzione.</appearance>
        <flavor>birra in genere maltosa anche se può avere un’ampia gamma di gusti originati dal malto e dal lievito (maltato, dolce, caramello, toffee, pane tostato, frutta secca, cioccolato, caffè, torrefatto, frutta, liquirizia, prugna, susina). Finale può essere da dolce a secco ma con le versioni più scure il finale è secco e torrefatto. Amaro da basso a moderato, quel che basta per dare un equilibrio senza coprire il malto.

        <history>storicamente la Mild era semplicemente una birra non invecchiata e il termine poteva essere usato per distinguere le birre invecchiate o più luppolate di lunga durata. Le Mild moderne hanno la loro origine nelle ale “X” più leggere del 19° secolo, anche se le Dark Mild apparvero solo nel 20° secolo. Nell’uso corrente il termine implica una birra poco alcolica con meno amaro della Bitter. Queste linee guida descrivono la versione britannica moderna. I consumatori non amano più il termine “Mild” e molti birrifici non lo usano più. Sempre più rara. Non esiste nessuna relazione storica tra Mild e Porter.</history>

        <history>la Brown Ale ha una lunga storia in Gran Bretagna, anche se non pochi prodotti differenti hanno usato questo nome in tempi diversi. Le moderne Brown Ale inglesi sono una invenzione come birra in bottiglia del 20° secolo e sono diverse dai prodotti storici con lo stesso nome. Si producevano con ampia gamma di alcolicità ma quelle moderne sono tutte interpretazioni più alcoliche (secondo gli attuali standard inglesi). Questo stile ha come base le moderne Brown Ale inglesi più alcoliche e non le versioni storiche o la più dolce Brown Ale londinese. Attualmente sono predominanti le versioni in bottiglia.</history>

        <comments>la descrizione di questo stile si riferisce alla versione moderna della Porter inglese e non ogni possibile variante storica di ogni regione dove era prodotta. Rielaborazioni storiche devono essere inserite nella categoria Historical Style con una descrizione appropriata del profilo della birra. Gli esempi artigianali moderni nel Regno Unito sono più alcolici e luppolati.</comments>
        <history>la Porter ebbe origine a Londra circa 300 anni fa ed era una evoluzione delle birre scure dolci, popolari al tempo. Nel corso dei secoli si è evoluta parecchio, seguendo gli sviluppi tecnici, gli ingredienti e le preferenze dei consumatori. Divenne molto popolare e ampiamente esportata nell’800 prima di declinare intorno alla Prima Guerra Mondiale e sparire negli anni ’50. Fu re-introdotta a metà anni ’70 con la nascita delle birre artigianali. Si dice che il nome derivi dal fatto che era popolare presso i lavoratori londinesi impegnati nel carico e scarico merci. Sono esistite molte interpretazioni regionali realizzate nel tempo e precursore di tutte le Stout (che in origine si chiamavano “Stout Porter”). Non esiste nessuna relazione storica tra Mild e Porter.</history>
        <ingredients>i malti variano ma qualche varietà che impartisce il colore scuro è sempre presente. Molto comuni i malti Chocolate o altri torrefatti, il malto caramello, zuccheri fermentabili et similia. Le Porter tipo London usano spesso malto Brown come caratterizzante del gusto.</ingredients>
        <comparison>differisce dalle Porter americane in quanto ha gusti più delicati, più dolci e più caramellati, minor gravità e di solito anche meno alcol. Le Porter americane hanno di solito più carattere di luppolo. Ha più sostanza e più torrefatto della British Brown Ale e maggior gravità della Dark Mild.</comparison>

      <notes>Il significato originale di “Schilling Ale” è stato descritto in modo sbagliato per molti anni. Nessun stile di birra è mai stato denominato 60/-, 70/- o 80/-. Gli scellini si riferivano al solo costo solo della botte di birra, intendendo che c’erano Stout 54/- e IPA 86/- e via di seguito. Le Scottish Ale erano chiamate Light, Heavy ed Export, il che copriva lo spettro di costi da circa 60/- a 90/- ed erano sono semplicemente ale scure con accento sul malto. Le ale superiori a 120/- non rientrano in questa analisi, come pure le più alcoliche Scotch Ale (dette anche Wee Heavy). Le linee guida per le Scottish Light, Heavy ed Export sono da più o meno simili per ciascuno di questi stili. Col crescere della gravità aumenta il carattere delle birre in questione. Storicamente le tre tipologie di birra erano realizzate con il metodo parti-gyle (ossia dalla medesima cotta si otteneva un primo filtrato più forte e dai risciacqui birre più leggere) e rappresentavano l’adattamento locale delle pale ale inglesi con minore gravità, meno luppolo e colore più scuro (spesso da caramello aggiunto). Nelle versioni moderne (almeno quelle successive alla seconda guerra mondiale) si utilizza una più complessa miscela di malti.</notes>

      <notes>Le birre tradizionali irlandesi incluse in questa categoria sono da ambrate a scure, ad alta fermentazione di forza da moderata a leggermente forti e sono spesso ampiamente incomprese a causa delle differenze con i prodotti per l’export oppure oscurate dalle caratteristiche di birre ampiamente commercializzate da birrifici molto noti. Ogni stile in questa categoria ha caratteristiche ben più ampie rispetto a quanto comunemente creduto.</notes>

        <impression>birra facile da bere, spesso con gusti delicati. Leggermente maltata, talvolta con una leggera iniziale dolcezza di toffee/caramello, un palato di lieve cereale e di biscotto e un tocco di torrefatto nel finale. Alcune versioni possono enfatizzare di più la dolcezza e il caramello, mentre altre favoriscono il palato di cereale e il secco torrefatto.</impression>
        <aroma>malto da basso a moderato, da cereale neutro o con leggere note di caramello-tostato-toffee. Può avere una leggerissima burrosità (anche se non è richiesta). L’aroma di luppolo terroso o floreale varia da nullo a basso (di solito non è presente). Aroma molto pulito.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da ambrato medio a ramato-rossiccio medio. Limpida, schiuma bassa da color crema a marrone-rossiccio con persistenza media.</appearance>
        <flavor>gusto e dolcezza di malto caramellato da leggerissimo a moderato, di rado con toni leggeri di pane tostato imburrato o toffee. Il palato è spesso abbastanza neutro con sapore di cereale o può assumere una nota leggermente tostata o di biscotto che termina con un gusto lieve di cereale torrefatto che impartisce un secco caratteristico al finale. Pochi o niente esteri. L’equilibrio tende leggermente verso il malto, anche se il piccolo impiego di cereali torrefatti può aumentare di poco la percezione di amaro.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio-leggero a medio anche se gli esempi contenenti bassi livelli di diacetile possono impartire una leggera untuosità (non richiesta). Carbonazione moderata. Delicata e moderatamente attenuata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>in questo stile esistono parecchie varianti che rendono queste linee guida un po’ generiche per poterle inglobare tutte. Gli esempi tradizionali irlandesi hanno relativamente poca luppolatura, hanno note di cereale con un leggero secco torrefatto nel finale e in generale sono abbastanza neutre. Gli esempi moderni irlandesi per l’export sono più caramellati e dolci e potrebbero avere più esteri. Le versioni artigianali americane sono spesso versioni più alcoliche delle Irish Export. La scena emergente delle birre artigianali irlandesi esplora invece le versioni più amare di quelle tradizionali. Infine, ci sono alcuni esempi commerciali che suonano Irish, ma sono in realtà International Amber lager, con palato più dolce e poco amaro. Queste linee guida si riferiscono agli esempi tradizionali irlandesi, con piccole divagazioni per le versioni Irish Export e le moderne versioni artigianali prodotte in Irlanda.</comments>
        <history>mentre l’Irlanda ha una lunga tradizione di Ale, il moderno stile Irish Red Ale è essenzialmente un adattamento o interpretazione dello stile English Bitter con meno luppolatura e un po’ di malto torrefatto per dare colore e secchezza. Riscoperta come stile di birra artigianale in Irlanda, oggi è elemento essenziale della gamma di gran parte dei birrifici, insieme alla Pale Ale e la Stout.</history>
        <ingredients>generalmente in genere ha un poco di orzo torrefatto o malto Black per impartire il colore rossiccio e il finale secco da torrefatto. Malto base Pale. I malti caramello storicamente erano importati e quindi più costosi, non tutti i birrai li usavano.</ingredients>
        <comparison>l’equivalente meno amaro e meno luppolato della English Bitter con finale secco dovuto all’orzo torrefatto. Più attenuata, con meno gusto di caramello e meno corpo delle ale scozzesi con equivalente alcolicità.</comparison>

        <impression>birra nera con pronunciato gusto di torrefatto spesso simile al caffè. L’equilibrio varia da bilanciato ad alquanto amaro con le versioni più bilanciate che presentano una lieve dolcezza di malto e quelle amare invece abbastanza secche. Le versioni alla spina sono tipicamente cremose per il carbo-azoto ma le versioni in bottiglia non hanno tale caratteristica. Il gusto di torrefatto può variare da secco, simile al caffè, a sentori di cioccolato.</impression>

Tipicamente ha gusti che ricordano il caffè, ma può anche avere caratteristiche dolce-amare e di cioccolato amaro al palato che perdurano nel finale. I fattori equilibranti includono la cremosità, il fruttato bassissimo e il gusto di luppolo (terroso) da nullo a medio.

Può avere una leggera astringenza proveniente dai cereali torrefatti, ma l’asprezza è indesiderata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>quando un birrificio proponeva una Stout e una Porter, di solito la Stout era la più alcolica (originariamente era chiamata Stout Porter). Le versioni moderne sono prodotte a minore gravità e non sono più alcoliche delle Porter. Oggi è tipicamente un prodotto alla spina; le versioni in bottiglia hanno comunemente una gravità maggiore e sono chiamate Extra Stout. In Irlanda esistono differenze regionali come per le English Bitter. Le Stout tipo Dublino usano contengono orzo torrefatto, sono più amare e più secche. Le Stout di Cork sono più dolci, meno amare e hanno gusto di cioccolato e di malti speciali. Gli esempi commerciali sono quasi sempre serviti alla spina con carbo-azoto. Le tradizionali birre rifermentate in bottiglia non avranno la struttura piena e cremosa o la schiuma molto persistente delle versioni alla spina.</comments>
        <history>questo stile ebbe origine dai tentativi di capitalizzare il successo delle Porter londinesi, ma in origine rivelava un corpo più pieno e cremoso e una più robusta alcolicità. La Guinness iniziò a produrre Porter nel 1799 e “un più robusto tipo di Porter” intorno al 1810. La Irish Stout si diversificò dalla Single Stout londinese (la Porter) nel tardo 1800 con l’impiego di malti più scuri. La Guinness fu tra le prime birrerie ad usare malto Black brevettato Patent per le Porter e le Stout nel decennio 1820 e cominciò ad usare utilizzare orzo torrefatto dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale, mentre i birrai di Londra continuavano ad usare malto Brown. Guinness iniziò poi a usare orzo in fiocchi negli anni ’50 e aumentò parecchio l’attenuazione. La Guinness Draught fu lanciata come marchio nel 1959. La Draught in lattina “tipo spina” e le bottiglie furono sviluppate nei tardi anni ’80 e ’90.</history>
        <ingredients>la Guinness è prodotta usando orzo torrefatto, orzo in fiocchi e malto Pale, ma gli altri birrifici non usano necessariamente l’orzo torrefatto: possono usare malto Chocolate o altri malti scuri o speciali. Qualunque combinazione di malti si usi, la birra risultante dovrebbe essere nera. Le Stout di Cork sono forse più vicine nella composizione alle Stout storiche di tipo londinese, con una varietà di malti non dominata dall’orzo torrefatto.</ingredients>
        <comparison>meno alcolicità della Irish Extra Stout ma gusti simili. Più scura di colore (nera) della English Porter (marrone).</comparison>

        <comments>tradizionalmente un prodotto in bottiglia. I consumatori si aspettano che una Stout abbia colore nero e intensità di gusto proveniente dagli ingredienti che l’hanno fatta resa nera. Non tutti i birrifici producono la versione secca e torrefatta tipica della Guinness, ugualmente accettabili sono le versioni più bilanciate e con note di cioccolato.</comments>
        <history>prodotto più forte ma con le stesse radici della Irish Stout. La Guinness Extra Stout (Extra Superior Porter, in seguito chiamata Double Stout) fu prodotta per la prima volta nel 1821 ed era primariamente un prodotto in bottiglia. Descritta dalla Guinness come “una birra a corpo più pieno e con una più intensa caratteristica di amaro da torrefatto, struttura ricca e matura”. Di tutti i tipi di Guinness sul mercato odierno, questa è la più vicina alla Porter originale prodotta da Arthur Guinness. Si noti che oggi la Guinness Extra Stout ha diverse gravità in diverse regioni: la versione europea ha circa 4,2% e rientra nello stile Irish Stout.</history>
        <ingredients>Simili a quelli della Irish Stout.</ingredients>
        <comparison>a metà strada tra la Irish Stout e la Foreign Extra Stout per alcolicità e intensità dei gusti e con equilibrio simile. Più corpo, ricchezza e spesso più complessità di malto della Irish Stout. Nera di colore, non marrone come la Porter.</comparison>

        <comments>le gravità sono basse in Inghilterra, più alte nelle birre esportate e in quelle americane. Esistono variazioni rispetto alla dolcezza residua, all’intensità del carattere torrefatto e all’equilibrio tra di essi: sono queste le variabili più soggette all’interpretazione personale. Alcune versioni inglesi sono molto dolci (bassa attenuazione) a anche basse in alcol (la Tennent’s Sweetheart Stout ha 2%), ma sono una anomalia rispetto agli altri esempi. Queste linee guida descrivono principalmente le versioni export con maggior gravità, più bilanciate piuttosto che le versioni a basso alcol e molto dolci che sono difficili da trovare.</comments>
        <history>stile di Stout inglese sviluppatosi ai primi del ‘900. Storicamente nota come Milk o Cream Stout, legalmente ora questa designazione non è più permessa in Inghilterra (ma è accettata altrove). Il nome Milk deriva dall’uso del lattosio o zucchero del latte come agente dolcificante. Originariamente fu immessa nel mercato come un tonico per i convalescenti o le madri in allattamento.</history>
        <ingredients>la dolcezza di gran parte delle Sweet Stout proviene dai bassi livelli di amaro rispetto alle altre Stout e dall’alta percentuale di destrine non fermentabili. Il lattosio, zucchero non fermentabile, viene aggiunto di frequente per impartire una dolcezza aggiuntiva residua. Malto pale come base e si possono aggiungere orzo tostato, malti Black, Chocolate, Crystal e pure succedanei come mais o zuccheri fermentabili.</ingredients>
        <comparison>molto più dolce e meno amara delle altre Stout (tranne la più robusta Tropical Stout). Il carattere di torrefatto è morbido e non bruciaticcio come per le altre Stout. Equilibrio in qualche modo simile a quello delle Oatmeal Stout, ma molto più dolci.</comparison>

L’avena e i cereali scuri torrefatti impartiscono complessità nel gusto: l’avena può aggiungere gusti terrosi, di nocciola e cereale. I cereali scuri possono combinarsi col dolce del malto a suggerire cioccolato al latte o caffè con panna. Amaro da luppolo medio con equilibrio spostato verso il malto.

        <comments>in generale come dolcezza si pone tra le Sweet Stout e le Irish Stout. Esistono variazioni: dal molto dolce al decisamente secco, come pure tra le versioni inglesi e americane (quelle americane tendono a essere più luppolate, meno dolci e meno fruttate). Variabile anche il livello di amaro e pure l’impronta dell’avena. Un uso limitato di avena può dare un corpo setoso e ricchezza di gusto, mentre un uso massiccio può impartire gusti molto intensi con sensazioni oleose in bocca, finale secco e una leggera astringenza da cereale. Quando si giudica, tenere presente le differenze di interpretazione.</comments>
        <history>una variante del tardo 1800 delle Stout “nutrienti e per convalescenti” con avena, analoga alla Sweet Stout con lattosio. Una versione scozzese originale utilizzava una significativa quantità di malto d’avena. Successivamente attraversò una fase ambigua in cui alcuni produttori inglesi inserivano una manciata d’avena nelle loro stout parti-gyle per ottenere una versione legalmente accetta bile e “salutare” di Oatmeal Stout per motivi commerciali. Birra molto popolare in Inghilterra tra le due guerre, ebbe un revival per l’export nell’era delle birre artigianali e questo ha contribuito alla sua popolarità quale moderno stile birrario artigianale in America caratterizzato da una buona (non simbolica) quantità di avena.</history>
        <ingredients>malti Pale, Caramel, torrefatti scuri (spesso Chocolate) e cereali non maltati. L’avena o avena maltata (5-20% o più) è usata per accrescere la pienezza di corpo e la complessità di gusto. Luppoli primariamente per l’amaro. Si possono usare zuccheri fermentabili o sciroppi. Lievito inglese per Ale.</ingredients>
        <comparison>la gran maggior parte è un incrocio tra una Irish Extra Stout e una Sweet Stout con aggiunta di avena. Esistono parecchie variazioni: le versioni più dolci assomigliano maggiormente alla Sweet Stout con avena al posto del lattosio, mentre le versioni più secche ricordano il pieno gusto di nocciolato delle Irish Extra Stout. Entrambe tendono ad enfatizzare la corposità e le sensazioni boccali.</comparison>

Versioni storiche (precedenti alla seconda guerra mondiale) avevano la medesima OG delle Extra Stout domestiche ma con un più alto livello alcolico a causa della lunga maturazione in cui i Brettanomiceti agivano in tal senso. La differenza tra versione domestiche e “foreign” erano la luppolatura e i tempi di maturazione.</comments>
        <history>Stout più robusta prodotta oggi per l’export, ma con una storia che risale ai secoli 18° e 19° quando era maggiormente luppolata. La Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (in origine West India Porter, in seguito Foreign Extra Double Stout) fu prodotta per la prima volta nel 1801 e secondo la Guinness “con luppoli extra per dare un gusto distintivo e miglior conservazione nei climi caldi. Prodotta [oggigiorno] in Africa, Asia e nei Caraibi. Attualmente rappresenta fino al 40% di tutta la Guinness prodotta nel mondo.”.</history>

        <impression>una ale di potenza alcolica rispettabile, tradizionalmente rifermentata in bottiglia e maturata a lungo. Può avere un’ampia gamma di interpretazioni, ma la maggior parte di esse ha livelli variabili di ricchezza di malto, luppoli da aroma, esteri fruttati e calore alcolico. I giudici dovrebbero concedere questa varietà di carattere: se è dentro i limiti indicati di forza alcolica e ha un interessante carattere “britannico”, allora rientra nello stile.</impression>
        <aroma>dolce-maltato con esteri fruttati, spesso con una miscela complessa di frutta secca, caramello, nocciole, toffee e/o altri aromi di malti speciali. Sono accettabili note alcoliche, ma non dovrebbero essere brucianti o di solvente. Gli aromi del luppolo possono variare molto ma tipicamente hanno note terrose, resinose e/o floreali. Equilibrio molto variabile, ma gli esempi più complessi hanno una mix di malto, fruttato, luppolo e alcol a intensità variabili.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da dorato intenso a bruno-rossiccio scuro (molte sono assai scure). Generalmente limpida, anche se le versioni più scure possono esser quasi opache. Schiuma da bassa a moderata di colore da crema a marrone-rossiccio e con media ritenzione.</appearance>
        <flavor>carattere di malto da medio ad alto spesso con cioccolato, toffee o caramello. Nelle versioni più scure si percepiscono talvolta note leggere di cioccolato e può anche avere una interessante complessità proveniente dagli zuccheri aggiunti. L’equilibrio è spesso verso il malto ma può essere anche ben luppolato, influenzando l'impronta di maltosità. Comune la presenza moderata di esteri fruttati con frutta scura o frutta secca. Il finale varia da medio-secco a leggermente dolce. Dovrebbe essere evidente l’alcol, ma non dominante. Diacetile da nullo a basso, in generale non desiderabile.</flavor>

        <comments>una categoria per concorsi più che uno stile, in cui la potenza e il carattere degli esempi variano ampiamente. Questo stile sta tra le birre a gravità normale (Strong Bitter, Brown Ale, Porter inglese) e le Barleywine e può anche includere birre chiare maltate o luppolate, le Winter Warmer inglesi, le Strong Dark Mild e le più leggere Burton Ale e altre birre particolari di media gravità che non possono essere incluse in altre categorie. Tradizionalmente è un prodotto rifermentato in bottiglia, adatto a essere maturato a lungo.</comments>
        <history>il carattere varia, dal momento che questa categoria riflette un raggruppamento di stili minori non in relazione tra loro a produzione limitata. Alcune sono rifacimenti storici, mentre altre sono moderne. Alcune discendono direttamente da stili più antichi come le Burton Ale e altre mantengono un collegamento storico con birre del passato. È un’idea di raggruppamento relativamente moderna, poiché questa categoria alcolica non era insolita nei secoli passati. Non usare questa categoria per ipotizzare relazioni storiche tra i diversi esempi: questa è una categorie di specialità britanniche dove la specialità fa riferimento al livello alcolico.</history>
        <ingredients>i malti variano, spesso basati su malti Pale, caramello e altri malti speciali. Alcuni esempi di birra scura suggeriscono che i malti scuri (tipo Chocolate o Black Malt) sono appropriati, anche se si devono usare con parsimonia per evitare gusti eccessivamente torrefatti. Sono comuni le aggiunte di zuccheri e di amidacei (mais, fiocchi d’orzo, frumento). I luppoli per aroma sono tradizionalmente inglesi.</ingredients>
        <comparison>sovrapposizione significativa nella gravità con le Old Ale, ma senza quel carattere di stantio o invecchiato. È possibile un’ampia gamma di interpretazioni, ma non dovrebbe essere ricca e forte come i Barleywine inglesi. Più alcolica delle birre alcoliche di tutti i giorni (Strong Bitter, Brown Ale, Porter). Ha più carattere zuccherato e di malto speciale e zuccheri delle Strong Ale americane.</comparison>

        <impression>una ale con forza alcolica da moderata ad alquanto significativa, maggiore delle birre standard, anche se non forte e ricca come i Barleywine. L’equilibrio è spesso verso il malto. “Dovrebbe essere una birra riscaldante da bere in mezze pinte vicino ad un focolare in una fredda notte d’inverno” – Michael Jackson.</impression>
        <aroma>maltato-dolce con esteri fruttati, spesso in una miscela complessa di frutta secca, vinoso, caramello, melassa, nocciola, toffee, sciroppo di zucchero e/o aromi da altri malti speciali. Sono accettabili note di alcol e di ossidazione, simili a quelle che si ritrovano nello Sherry e nel Porto. Gli aromi del luppolo non sono di solito presenti per il lungo invecchiamento.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da ambrato chiaro a bruno-rossiccio scuro (la maggior parte è alquanto scura). L’età e l’ossidazione possono scurire ulteriormente la birra. Può sembrare opaca (se non lo è, dovrebbe essere limpida). Schiuma da bassa a moderata e di colore variabile dal crema al bruno-rossiccio chiaro, può essere influenzata negativamente dall’alcol e dall’invecchiamento.</appearance>
        <flavor>maltosità da media ad alta con una seducente complessità di nocciola, caramello e/o melassa. l gusti di cioccolato o malto torrefatto sono opzionali e non devono mai essere prominenti. L’equilibrio è spesso verso il maltato-dolce ma può anche essere verso il deciso luppolato (il carattere amaro spesso dipende dall’invecchiamento). Gli esteri fruttati da moderati ad alti sono comuni e hanno un carattere di frutta secca o vinoso. Il finale può variare da secco a dolciastro. La lunga maturazione può impartire gusti di ossidato simili a quelli dell’ottimo Sherry invecchiato, Porto o Madera. La forza alcolica deve essere evidente, anche se non sovrastante. Diacetile da nullo a basso. Alcune versioni maturate in botte o miscelate possono avere gusti di lattico o di brettanomiceti: è un fatto opzionale e comunque la loro presenza non deve essere troppo la evidente. Acidità e tannini provenienti dall’invecchiamento devono risultare ben integrati nella birra e contribuire alla complessità del profilo gustativo e non essere dominanti.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio a pieno, quasi da masticabile, anche se gli esempi più invecchiati possono avere corpo più leggero per l’attenuazione continuata durante la maturazione. Il calore dell’alcol è spesso evidente e sempre gradito. Carbonazione da bassa a moderata a seconda dell’età e della maturazione. Possono essere presenti una leggera acidità e dei tannini se maturata in botte: entrambi sono tuttavia opzionali.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>la potenza e il carattere variano ampiamente. La qualità predominante che definisce questo stile è il segno del passare del tempo che si manifesta in modi differenti (complessità, lattico, brettato, ossidazione, cuoio e vinosità, ecc.). Anche se queste qualità possono sembrare difetti, se la birra è ancora complessa e piacevole da bere, allora tali caratteristiche sono accettabili. In ogni caso, queste caratteristiche non devono giustificare una birra scorretta e imbevibile, anche se ha dei parametri che rientrano nello stile. La Old Peculier è una birra unica nel suo genere ed è parecchio differente dalle altre Old Ale.</comments>
        <history>storicamente è una Mild invecchiata (quando le Mild erano birre più alcoliche). Era usata come birra da cantina per la miscelazione o per essere bevuta tal quale (per cantina si intende birra invecchiata o tenuta per un significativo periodo di tempo). Ci sono oggi almeno due tipologie in Gran Bretagna: birre più leggere alla spina che assomigliano alle mild mature di circa 4,5% e più forti che sono spesso sui 6-8% o più.</history>
        <ingredients>la composizione è variabile anche se in genere è simile a quella delle English Strong Ale. Il fattore età è il maggior responsabile del profilo finale dello stile, più facile da gestire rispetto alla semplice produzione in se. Può essere invecchiata in botti di legno ma non deve avere un forte sapore di barricato.</ingredients>
        <comparison>pressappoco sovrapponibile alle British Strong Ale e all’estremità inferiore dei Barleywine inglesi ma sempre con le caratteristiche date dall’invecchiamento. La distinzione tra una Old Ale e un Barleywine è approssimativa sopra i 7% ABV e generalmente fa riferimento a maggiori caratteristiche di invecchiamento (in particolare dal legno). I Barleywine tendono a sviluppare caratteristiche “mature”, mentre le Old Ale mostrano maggiori caratteristiche dalla botte (lattico, Brett, vinoso, etc.).</comparison>

        <impression>ricche, maltose, destrinche e di solito dolci da caramello, queste birre sembrano un dessert. I gusti secondari complessi del malto secondario e dell’alcol le impediscono di essere una birra monodimensionale.

        <aroma>maltato intenso con una forte componente di caramello. Possono essere presenti aromi secondari leggermente affumicati che aumentano la complessità; il torbato è inappropriato. Il diacetile dovrebbe essere da basso a nullo. Esteri e alcolicità sono spesso presenti nelle versioni più alcoliche. Aroma di luppolo da nullo a molto basso e può essere leggermente terroso o floreale.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore da ramato chiaro a marrone scuro, spesso con intensi riflessi rubino. Limpida con schiuma generosa che può non persistere a lungo. Archetti possono evidenziarsi nelle versioni più alcoliche.</appearance>
        <flavor>riccamente maltato con caramello significativo (specialmente nelle versioni più alcoliche). Possono essere presenti cenni di malto torrefatto (talvolta percepite come un debole affumicato) e note di nocciola che perdurano nel finale. Il torbato è inappropriato. I gusti del luppolo e l’amaro sono da bassi a medio-bassi, quindi la presenza del malto dovrebbe dominare l’equilibrio generale. Il diacetile dovrebbe essere molto basso o nullo. Sono di solito presenti il gusto di alcol ed esteri da un livello basso a moderato. Gli esteri ricordano le prugne, l’uvetta o la frutta secca. Al palato è piena e dolce, ma il finale può variare da dolce a medio-secco, talvolta con una leggera nota di cereale/torrefatto.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>corpo da medio-pieno a pieno, con alcune versioni (non tutte) che hanno una densa viscosità, quasi masticabile. Calore delicato dell’alcol di solito presente e gradito, dal momento che bilancia la dolcezza del malto. Carbonazione moderata.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>nota anche come Strong Scotch Ale. I termine “wee heavy” significa “piccola forte” e fa riferimento alla birra che ha reso noto il termine: Fowler’s Wee Heavy, una ale da 12 ghinee. Storicamente, la birra più forte realizzata da ale scozzese con metodo parti-gyle.</comments>
        <history>più in relazione con le birre storiche che con le ale scozzesi moderne a basso tenore alcolico, queste birre hanno le loro radici nelle Strong Ale del 1700 e 1800, anche se sono cambiate le formule e le metodologie.

        <impression>un tripudio di ricchezza di malto e gusti intensi e complessi. Corpo ricco, quasi masticabile, con calore alcolico e piacevole fruttato o luppolato. Quando è invecchiata può assumere gusti di Porto. Birra invernale da sorseggiare.</impression>
        <aroma>molto ricco e fortemente maltato. Le versioni più scure hanno spesso aromi simili al caramello e le più chiare un leggero carattere di toffee. Possono avere un fruttato da moderato a forte, spesso di frutta scura o secca, soprattutto nelle versioni scure. L’aroma di luppolo varia da lieve a deciso ed è tipicamente floreale, terroso o simile alla marmellata d’agrumi. Gli aromatici dell’alcol variano da bassi a moderati ma sono morbidi e rotondi. L’intensità di questi composti aromatici diminuisce spesso con l’età. L’aroma può avere un ricco carattere con note di pane, pane tostato, toffee e/o melassa. Le versioni più invecchiate hanno aromi tipo Sherry, vinoso o di Porto e in genere aromi di malto più smorzati/attenuati.</aroma>
        <appearance>colore variabile da dorato carico ad ambrato molto scuro e perfino marrone scuro (spesso con riflessi color rubino, che non dovrebbero essere opachi). Schiuma da bassa a moderata, color avorio con poca ritenzione. Potrebbe presentarsi torbida se raffreddata eccessivamente, ma in genere torna limpida e brillante con l’innalzarsi della temperatura. Il colore può avere una grande profondità, come se si guardasse attraverso una grossa lente. L’alto contenuto alcolico e la viscosità possono essere visibili negli archetti prodotti facendo ruotare il bicchiere.</appearance>
        <flavor>gusti forti, intensi, complessi di malto che variano dal pane, toffee e biscotto nelle versioni più chiare alla nocciola, tostato deciso, caramello scuro e/o melassa nelle versioni più scure. Al palato una dolcezza di malto da moderata ad alta, anche se il finale può variare dal moderatamente dolce al secco moderato (a seconda dell’età). Possono essere presenti gusti di ossidato o vinosi e spesso sono evidenti i gusti complessi dell’alcol. Fruttato da moderato a molto elevato con caratteristiche di frutta scura o secca. L’amaro del luppolo può variare da un minimo necessario per l’equilibrio ad una decisa presenza: l’equilibrio varia quindi dal maltato al lieve amaro. Le versioni chiare sono spesso più amare, meglio attenuate e con più carattere di luppolo rispetto alle versioni più scure. In ogni caso, tutte le versioni sono tendono al maltato. Gusti di luppolo da bassi a moderatamente alti, spesso varietà inglesi floreali, terrose o di marmellata di arancia.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>birra di pieno corpo e quasi masticabile, con una struttura vellutata e dolcissima (anche se il corpo può ridursi per la lunga maturazione).

        <comments>la più ricca e la più alcolica delle moderne ale inglesi. Il carattere dei Barleywine può cambiare in modo significativo col tempo: sia le giovani che le mature dovrebbero essere apprezzate per quello che sono. Il profilo del malto può variare molto e non tutti gli esempi posseggono l’intero spettro di gusti e aromi possibili. Le varietà più chiare non possono avere i gusti di malto ricco e caramello e neppure il tipico fruttato da frutta scura secca: non bisogna aspettarsi gusti e aromi impossibili per una birra di quel colore. Tipicamente scritto “Barley Wine” nel Regno Unito e “Barleywine” in USA.</comments>
        <history>per secoli sono state prodotte Strong Ale con varie formulazioni in Inghilterra ed erano note con varie denominazioni. I moderni Barleywine si rifanno alla Bass No. 1 che fu chiamata per prima Barleywine nel 1872. I Barleywine erano più scuri fino a che la Tennant (ora Whitbread) produsse per prima la Gold Label (un Barleywine dorato) nel 1951. Di solito è la birra più forte prodotta da una birreria e negli anni recenti sono apparsi sul mercato prodotti millesimati offerti ai consumatori come specialità invernale a serie limitata. Lo stile originale ha ispirato varianti in Belgio, USA e altrove nel mondo.</history>
        <ingredients>il malto Pale di alta qualità e ben modificato dovrebbe essere la spina dorsale, insieme a una giudiziosa quantità di malto caramello. I malti scuri devono essere usati in quantità molto ridotte, o per nulla, perché il colore proviene dalla bollitura prolungata. Sono tipici i luppoli inglesi come Northdown, Target, East Kent Goldings e Fuggles. Lievito britannico caratterizzante.</ingredients>
        <comparison>anche se è spesso ben luppolato, il Barleywine inglese pone meno l’accento sul luppolo rispetto al Barleywine americano e mette in evidenza i luppoli inglesi. Rispetto alle versioni americane, i Barleywine inglesi possono essere più scuri, più maltati, più fruttati ed evidenziare gusti più ricchi di malti speciali. SI sovrappone, nel range inferiore, alla British Old Ale, ma generalmente non ha le caratteristiche vinose da invecchiamento; piuttosto tende a mostrare i segni del tempo in modo maturo ed elegante.</comparison>

        <name>Blonde Ale</name>
        <impression>Easy-drinking, approachable, malt-oriented American craft beer, often with interesting fruit, hop, or character malt notes. Well-balanced and clean, is a refreshing pint without aggressive flavors.</impression>
        <aroma>Light to moderate sweet malty aroma, possibly with a light bready or caramelly note. Low to moderate fruitiness is optional, but acceptable. May have a low to medium hop aroma, and can reflect almost any hop variety although citrusy, floral, fruity, and spicy notes are common.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light yellow to deep gold in color. Clear to brilliant. Low to medium white head with fair to good retention.</appearance>
        <flavor>Initial soft malty sweetness, but optionally some light character malt flavor (e.g., bread, toast, biscuit, wheat) can also be present. Caramel flavors typically absent; if present, they are typically low-color caramel notes. Low to medium fruity esters optional, but are welcome. Light to moderate hop flavor (any variety), but shouldn’t be overly aggressive. Medium-low to medium bitterness, but the balance is normally towards the malt or even between malt and hops. Finishes medium-dry to slightly malty-sweet; impression of sweetness is often an expression of lower bitterness than actual residual sweetness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body. Medium to high carbonation. Smooth without being heavy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Brewpub alternative to standard American lagers, typically offered as an entry-level craft beer.</comments>
        <history>An American craft beer style produced by many microbreweries and brewpubs, particularly those who cannot produce lagers. Regional variations exist (many US West Coast brewpub examples are more assertive, like pale ales) but in most areas this beer is designed as the least challenging beer in their lineup.</history>
        <ingredients>Generally all malt, but can include up to 25% wheat malt and some sugar adjuncts. Any hop variety can be used. Clean American, lightly fruity English, or Kölsch yeast. May also be made with lager yeast, or cold-conditioned. Some versions may have honey, spices and/or fruit added, although if any of these ingredients are stronger than a background flavor they should be entered in those specialty categories instead.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Typically has more flavor than American Lagers and Cream Ales. Less bitterness than an American Pale Ale.</comparison>

        <name>American Pale Ale</name>
        <impression>A pale, refreshing and hoppy ale, yet with sufficient supporting malt to make the beer balanced and drinkable. The clean hop presence can reflect classic or modern American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of characteristics. An average-strength hop-forward pale American craft beer, generally balanced to be more accessible than modern American IPAs.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate to strong hop aroma from American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of possible characteristics, including citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon. None of these specific characteristics are required, but hops should be apparent. Low to moderate maltiness supports the hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready, toasty, biscuit, caramelly). Fruity esters vary from moderate to none. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this character should not be excessive.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale golden to light amber. Moderately large white to off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate to high hop flavor, typically showing an American or New World hop character (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). Low to moderate clean grainy-malt character supports the hop presentation, and may optionally show small amounts of specialty malt character (bready, toasty, biscuity). The balance is typically towards the late hops and bitterness, but the malt presence should be supportive, not distracting. Caramel flavors are often absent or fairly restrained (but are acceptable as long as they don’t clash with the hops). Fruity yeast esters can be moderate to none, although many hop varieties are quite fruity. Moderate to high hop bitterness with a medium to dry finish. Hop flavor and bitterness often lingers into the finish, but the aftertaste should generally be clean and not harsh. Dry hopping (if used) may add grassy notes, although this character should not be excessive.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Overall smooth finish without astringency and harshness.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>New hop varieties and usage methods continue to be developed. Judges should allow for characteristics of modern hops in this style, as well as classic varieties. Becoming more of an international craft style, with local adaptations appearing in many countries with an emerging craft beer market. Hopping styles can vary from the classic large bitterness addition, to more modern late hop-bursted examples; all variations are allowable.</comments>
        <history>A modern American craft beer era adaptation of English pale ale, reflecting indigenous ingredients (hops, malt, yeast, and water). Prior to the explosion in popularity of IPAs, was traditionally the most well-known and popular of American craft beers.</history>
        <ingredients>Pale ale malt, typically North American two-row. American or New World hops, with a wide range of allowable characteristics. American or English ale yeast (neutral to lightly fruity). Specialty grains may add character and complexity, but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt flavor and richness, light sweetness, and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate brands.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Typically lighter in color, cleaner in fermentation by-products, and having less caramel flavors than English counterparts. There can be some overlap in color between American pale ale and American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner, have a less caramelly malt profile, less body, and often more finishing hops. Less bitterness in the balance and alcohol strength than an American IPA. More balanced and drinkable, and less intensely hop-focused and bitter than session-strength American IPAs (aka Session IPAs).</comparison>

      <subcategory id="19A">
        <name>American Amber Ale</name>
        <impression>An amber, hoppy, moderate-strength American craft beer with a caramel malty flavor. The balance can vary quite a bit, with some versions being fairly malty and others being aggressively hoppy. Hoppy and bitter versions should not have clashing flavors with the caramel malt profile.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to moderate hop aroma with characteristics typical of American or New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon). A citrusy hop character is common, but not required. Moderately-low to moderately-high maltiness (usually with a moderate caramel character), which can either support, balance, or sometimes mask the hop presentation. Esters vary from moderate to none.</aroma>
        <appearance>Amber to coppery-brown in color. Moderately large off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear, although dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate to high hop flavor with characteristics typical of American or New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon). A citrusy hop character is common, but not required. Malt flavors are moderate to strong, and usually show an initial malty sweetness followed by a moderate caramel flavor (and sometimes other character malts in lesser amounts). Malt and hop bitterness are usually balanced and mutually supportive, but can vary either way. Fruity esters can be moderate to none. Caramel sweetness and hop flavor/bitterness can linger somewhat into the medium to full finish.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full body. Medium to high carbonation. Overall smooth finish without astringency. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Can overlap in color with darker American pale ales, but with a different malt flavor and balance. Regional variations exist with some being fairly mainstream and others being quite aggressive in hopping. Stronger and more bitter versions are now split into the <em>Red IPA</em> style.</comments>
        <history>A modern American craft beer style developed as a variation from American Pale Ales. Known simply as Red Ales in some regions, these beers were popularized in the hop-loving Northern California and the Pacific Northwest areas before spreading nationwide.</history>
        <ingredients>Pale ale malt, typically North American two-row. Medium to dark crystal malts. May also contain specialty grains which add additional character and uniqueness. American or New World hops, often with citrusy flavors, are common but others may also be used.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Darker, more caramelly, more body, and generally less bitter in the balance than American Pale Ales. Less alcohol, bitterness, and hop character than Red IPAs. Less strength, malt, and hop character than American Strong Ales. Should not have a strong chocolate or roast character that might suggest an American brown ale (although small amounts are OK).</comparison>

        <aroma>Typically showcases rustic, traditional American hops (often with woody, rustic or minty qualities) in moderate to high strength. Light fruitiness acceptable. Low to moderate caramel and/or toasty malt aromatics support the hops.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium amber to light copper color. Generally clear. Moderate off-white head with good retention.</appearance>

        <mouthfeel>Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example, although allowing other typical ingredients of the era. Northern Brewer hops are not a strict requirement for the style; modern American and New World-type hops (especially citrusy ones) are inappropriate, however.</comments>
        <history>American West Coast original, brewed originally as Steam Beer in the Gold Rush era. Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were traditionally used to compensate for the absence of refrigeration and to take advantage of the cool ambient temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Fermented with a lager yeast, but one that was selected to ferment relatively clean beer at warmer temperatures. Modern versions are based on Anchor Brewing re-launching the style in the 1970s.</history>
        <ingredients>Pale ale malt, non-citrusy hops (often Northern Brewer), small amounts of toasted malt and/or crystal malts. Lager yeast; however, some strains (often with the mention of “California” in the name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55 to 60 °F) typically used. Note that some German yeast strains produce inappropriate sulfury character.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Superficially similar to an American Amber Ale, but with specific choices for malt and hopping - the hop flavor/aroma is traditional (not modern) American hops, malt flavors are more toasty, the hopping is always assertive, and a warm-fermented lager yeast is used. Less attenuated, less carbonated and less fruity than Australian Sparkling ale.</comparison>

        <impression>A malty but hoppy beer frequently with chocolate and caramel flavors. The hop flavor and aroma complements and enhances the malt rather than clashing with it.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate malty-sweet to malty-rich aroma with chocolate, caramel, nutty, and/or toasty qualities. Hop aroma is typically low to moderate, of almost any variety that complements the malt. Some interpretations of the style may feature a stronger hop aroma, an American or New World hop character (citrusy, fruity, tropical, etc.), and/or a fresh dry-hopped aroma (all are optional). Fruity esters are moderate to very low. The dark malt character is more robust than other brown ales, yet stops short of being overly porter-like. The malt and hops are generally balanced.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light to very dark brown color. Clear. Low to moderate off-white to light tan head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to moderately-high malty-sweet or malty-rich flavor with chocolate, caramel, nutty, and/or toasty malt complexity, with medium to medium-high bitterness. The medium to medium-dry finish provides an aftertaste having both malt and hops. Hop flavor can be light to moderate, and may optionally have a citrusy, fruity, or tropical character, although any hop flavor that complements the malt is acceptable. Very low to moderate fruity esters.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full body. More bitter versions may have a dry, resiny impression. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most commercial American Browns are not as aggressive as the original homebrewed versions, and some modern craft-brewed examples. This style reflects the current commercial offerings typically marketed as American Brown Ales rather than the hoppier, stronger homebrew versions from the early days of homebrewing. These IPA-strength brown ales should be entered in the <em>Specialty IPA</em> as Brown IPAs.</comments>
        <history>An American style from the modern craft beer era. Derived from English Brown Ales, but with more hops. Pete’s Wicked Ale was one of the first and best known examples, and inspired many imitations. Popular with homebrewers, where very hoppy versions were sometimes called <em>Texas Brown Ales</em> (this is now more appropriately a Brown IPA).</history>
        <ingredients>Well-modified pale malt, plus crystal and darker malts (typically chocolate). American hops are typical, but continental or New World hops can also be used.</ingredients>
        <comparison>More chocolate and caramel type flavors than American Pale or Amber Ales, typically with less prominent bitterness in the balance. Less bitterness, alcohol, and hop character than Brown IPAs. More bitter and generally hoppier than English Brown Ales, with a richer malt presence, usually higher alcohol, and American/New World hop character.</comparison>

      <notes>These beers all evolved from their English namesakes to be wholly transformed by American craft brewers. Generally, these styles are bigger, stronger, more roast-forward, and more hop-centric than their Anglo cousins. These styles are grouped together due to a similar shared history and flavor profile.</notes>
      <subcategory id="20A">
        <name>American Porter</name>
        <impression>A substantial, malty dark beer with a complex and flavorful dark malt character.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium-light to medium-strong dark malt aroma, often with a lightly burnt character. Optionally may also show some additional malt character in support (grainy, bready, toffee-like, caramelly, chocolate, coffee, rich, and/or sweet). Hop aroma low to high, often with a resiny, earthy, or floral character. May be dry-hopped. Fruity esters are moderate to none.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium brown to very dark brown, often with ruby- or garnet-like highlights. Can approach black in color. Clarity may be difficult to discern in such a dark beer, but when not opaque will be clear (particularly when held up to the light). Full, tan-colored head with moderately good head retention.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately strong malt flavor usually features a lightly burnt malt character (and sometimes chocolate and/or coffee flavors) with a bit of grainy, dark malt dryness in the finish. Overall flavor may finish from dry to medium-sweet. May have a sharp character from dark roasted grains, but should not be overly acrid, burnt or harsh. Medium to high bitterness, which can be accentuated by the dark malt. Hop flavor can vary from low to high with a resiny, earthy, or floral character, and balances the dark malt flavors. The dark malt and hops should not clash. Dry-hopped versions may have a resiny flavor. Fruity esters moderate to none.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full body. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth. May have a slight astringency from dark malts, although this character should not be strong.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation. Dark malt intensity and flavor can vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop character, and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus may seem to have an “American” or “British” character.</comments>
        <history>A stronger, more aggressive version of pre-prohibition porters and/or English porters developed in the modern craft beer era. Historical versions existed, particularly on the US East Coast, some of which are still being produced (see the Historical Beer, Pre-Prohibition Porter). This style describes the modern craft version.</history>
        <ingredients>May contain several malts, prominently dark malts, which often include black malt (chocolate malt is also often used). American hops typically used for bittering, but US or UK finishing hops can be used; a clashing citrus quality is generally undesirable. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or characterful English varieties.</ingredients>
        <comparison>More bitter and often stronger with more dark malt qualities and dryness than English Porters or Pre-Prohibition Porters. Less strong and assertive than American Stouts.</comparison>

        <name>American Stout</name>
        <impression>A fairly strong, highly roasted, bitter, hoppy dark stout. Has the body and dark flavors typical of stouts with a more aggressive American hop character and bitterness.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate to strong aroma of roasted malts, often having a roasted coffee or dark chocolate quality. Burnt or charcoal aromas are acceptable at low levels. Medium to very low hop aroma, often with a citrusy or resiny character. Medium to no esters. Light alcohol-derived aromatics are also optional.</aroma>
        <appearance>Generally a jet black color, although some may appear very dark brown. Large, persistent head of light tan to light brown in color. Usually opaque.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate to very high roasted malt flavors, often tasting of coffee, roasted coffee beans, dark or bittersweet chocolate. May have the flavor of slightly burnt coffee grounds, but this character should not be prominent. Low to medium malt sweetness, often with rich chocolate or caramel flavors. Medium to high bitterness. Low to high hop flavor, generally citrusy or resiny. Low to no esters. Medium to dry finish, occasionally with a lightly burnt quality. Alcohol flavors can be present up to medium levels, but smooth.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to full body. Can be somewhat creamy, particularly if a small amount of oats have been used to enhance mouthfeel. Can have a bit of roast-derived astringency, but this character should not be excessive. Medium-high to high carbonation. Light to moderately strong alcohol warmth, but smooth and not excessively hot.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Breweries express individuality through varying the roasted malt profile, malt sweetness and flavor, and the amount of finishing hops used. Generally has bolder roasted malt flavors and hopping than other traditional stouts (except Imperial Stouts).</comments>
        <history>A modern craft beer and homebrew style that applied an aggressive American hoping regime to a strong traditional English or Irish stout. The homebrew version was previously known as West Coast Stout, which is a common naming scheme for a more highly-hopped beer.</history>
        <ingredients>Common American base malts and yeast. Varied use of dark and roasted malts, as well as caramel-type malts. Adjuncts such as oatmeal may be present in low quantities. American hop varieties.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a hoppy, bitter, strongly roasted Extra or Export Stout. Much more roast and body than a Black IPA. Bigger, stronger versions belong in the Russian Imperial Stout style. Stronger and more assertive, particularly in the dark malt/grain additions and hop character, than American Porter.</comparison>

        <impression>An intensely-flavored, big, dark ale with a wide range of flavor balances and regional interpretations. Roasty-burnt malt with deep dark or dried fruit flavors, and a warming, bittersweet finish. Despite the intense flavors, the components need to meld together to create a complex, harmonious beer, not a hot mess.</impression>
        <aroma>Rich and complex, with variable amounts of roasted grains, maltiness, fruity esters, hops, and alcohol. The roasted malt character can take on coffee, dark chocolate, or slightly burnt tones and can be light to moderately strong. The malt aroma can be subtle to rich and barleywine-like. May optionally show a slight specialty malt character (e.g., caramel), but this should only add complexity and not dominate. Fruity esters may be low to moderately strong, and may take on a complex, dark fruit (e.g., plums, prunes, raisins) character. Hop aroma can be very low to quite aggressive, and may contain any hop variety. An alcohol character may be present, but shouldn’t be sharp, hot, or solventy. Aged versions may have a slight vinous or port-like quality, but shouldn’t be sour. The balance can vary with any of the aroma elements taking center stage. Not all possible aromas described need be present; many interpretations are possible. Aging affects the intensity, balance and smoothness of aromatics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color may range from very dark reddish-brown to jet black. Opaque. Deep tan to dark brown head. Generally has a well-formed head, although head retention may be low to moderate. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in “legs” when beer is swirled in a glass.</appearance>
        <flavor>Rich, deep, complex and frequently quite intense, with variable amounts of roasted malt/grains, maltiness, fruity esters, hop bitterness and flavor, and alcohol. Medium to aggressively high bitterness. Medium-low to high hop flavor (any variety). Moderate to aggressively high roasted malt/grain flavors can suggest bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate, cocoa, and/or strong coffee. A slightly burnt grain, burnt currant or tarry character may be evident. Fruity esters may be low to intense, and can take on a dark fruit character (raisins, plums, or prunes). Malt backbone can be balanced and supportive to rich and barleywine-like, and may optionally show some supporting caramel, bready or toasty flavors. The palate and finish can vary from relatively dry to moderately sweet, usually with some lingering roastiness, hop bitterness and warming character. The balance and intensity of flavors can be affected by aging, with some flavors becoming more subdued over time and some aged, vinous or port-like qualities developing.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Full to very full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline with long conditioning). Gentle smooth warmth from alcohol should be present and noticeable, but not a primary characteristic; in well-conditioned versions, the alcohol can be deceptive. Should not be syrupy or under-attenuated. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.</mouthfeel>
        <comments><em>Traditionally an English style, but it is currently much more popular and widely available in America where it is a craft beer favorite, not a curiosity.</em> Variations exist, with English and American interpretations (predictably, the American versions have more bitterness, roasted character, and finishing hops, while the English varieties reflect a more complex specialty malt character and a more forward ester profile). Not all Imperial Stouts have a clearly ‘English’ or ‘American’ character; anything in between the two variants are allowable as well, which is why it is counter-productive to designate a sub-type when entering a competition. The wide range of allowable characteristics allow for maximum brewer creativity. Judges must be aware of the broad range of the style, and not try to judge all examples as clones of a specific commercial beer.</comments>
        <history>A style with a long, although not necessarily continuous, heritage. Traces roots to strong English porters brewed for export in the 1700s, and said to have been popular with the Russian Imperial Court. After the Napoleonic wars interrupted trade, these beers were increasingly sold in England. The style eventually all but died out, until being popularly embraced in the modern craft beer era, both in England as a revival and in the United States as a reinterpretation or re-imagination by extending the style with American characteristics.</history>
        <ingredients>Well-modified pale malt, with generous quantities of roasted malts and/or grain. May have a complex grain bill using virtually any variety of malt. Any type of hops may be used. American or English ale yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a black barleywine with every dimension of flavor coming into play. More complex, with a broader range of possible flavors than lower-gravity stouts.</comparison>

      <notes>The IPA category is for modern American IPAs and their derivatives. This does not imply that English IPAs aren’t proper IPAs or that there isn’t a relationship between them. This is simply a method of grouping similar styles for competition purposes. English IPAs are grouped with other English-derived beers, and the stronger Double IPA is grouped with stronger American beers. The term “IPA” is intentionally not spelled out as “India Pale Ale” since none of these beers historically went to India, and many aren’t pale. However, the term IPA has come to be a balance-defined style in modern craft beer.</notes>

        <name>American IPA</name>
        <impression>A decidedly hoppy and bitter, moderately strong American pale ale, showcasing modern American or New World hop varieties. The balance is hop-forward, with a clean fermentation profile, dryish finish, and clean, supporting malt allowing a creative range of hop character to shine through.</impression>
        <aroma>A prominent to intense hop aroma featuring one or more characteristics of American or New World hops, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Many versions are dry hopped and can have an additional fresh hop aroma; this is desirable but not required. Grassiness should be minimal, if present. A low to medium-low clean, grainy-malty aroma may be found in the background. Fruitiness from yeast may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable. A restrained alcohol note may be present, but this character should be minimal at best. Any American or New World hop character is acceptable; new hop varieties continue to be released and should not constrain this style.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from medium gold to light reddish-amber. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Medium-sized, white to off-white head with good persistence.</appearance>
        <flavor>Hop flavor is medium to very high, and should reflect an American or New World hop character, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Medium-high to very high hop bitterness. Malt flavor should be low to medium-low, and is generally clean and grainy-malty although some light caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable. Low yeast-derived fruitiness is acceptable but not required. Dry to medium-dry finish; residual sweetness should be low to none. The bitterness and hop flavor may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. A very light, clean alcohol flavor may be noted in stronger versions. May be slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency. Very light, smooth alcohol warming not a fault if it does not intrude into overall balance.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A modern American craft beer interpretation of the historical English style, brewed using American ingredients and attitude. The basis for many modern variations, including the stronger Double IPA as well as IPAs with various other ingredients. Those other IPAs should generally be entered in the Specialty IPA style. Oak is inappropriate in this style; if noticeably oaked, enter in wood-aged category.</comments>
        <history>The first modern American craft beer example is generally believed to be Anchor Liberty Ale, first brewed in 1975 and using whole Cascade hops; the style has pushed beyond that original beer, which now tastes more like an American Pale Ale in comparison. American-made IPAs from earlier eras were not unknown (particularly the well-regarded Ballantine’s IPA, an oak-aged beer using an old English recipe). This style is based on the modern craft beer examples.</history>
        <ingredients>Pale ale or 2-row brewers malt as the base, American or New World hops, American or English yeast with a clean or slightly fruity profile. Generally all-malt, but mashed at lower temperatures for high attenuation. Sugar additions to aid attenuation are acceptable. Restrained use of crystal malts, if any, as high amounts can lead to a sweet finish and clash with the hop character.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Stronger and more highly hopped than an American Pale Ale. Compared to an English IPA, has less of the “English” character from malt, hops, and yeast (less caramel, bread, and toast; more American/New World hops than English; less yeast-derived esters), less body, and often has a more hoppy balance and is slightly stronger than most examples. Less alcohol than a Double IPA, but with a similar balance.</comparison>

        <name>Specialty IPA</name>
        <notes>Specialty IPA isn’t a distinct style, but is more appropriately thought of as a competition entry category. Beers entered as this style are not experimental beers; they are a collection of currently produced types of beer that may or may not have any market longevity. This category also allows for expansion, so potential future IPA variants (St. Patrick’s Day Green IPA, Romulan Blue IPA, Zima Clear IPA, etc.) have a place to be entered without redoing the style guidelines. The only common element is that they have the balance and overall impression of an IPA (typically, an American IPA) but with some minor tweak.</notes>
        <notes>The term ‘IPA’ is used as a singular descriptor of a type of hoppy, bitter beer. It is not meant to be spelled out as ‘India Pale Ale’ when used in the context of a Specialty IPA. None of these beers ever historically went to India, and many aren’t pale. But the craft beer market knows what to expect in balance when a beer is described as an ‘IPA’ - so the modifiers used to differentiate them are based on that concept alone.</notes>
        <impression>Recognizable as an IPA by balance - a hop-forward, bitter, dryish beer - with something else present to distinguish it from the standard categories. Should have good drinkability, regardless of the form. Excessive harshness and heaviness are typically faults, as are strong flavor clashes between the hops and the other specialty ingredients.</impression>
        <aroma>Detectable hop aroma is required; characterization of hops is dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA. Other aromatics may be present; hop aroma is typically the strongest element.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color depends on specific type of Specialty IPA. Most should be clear, although certain styles with high amounts of starchy adjuncts, or unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be slightly hazy. Darker types can be opaque making clarity irrelevant. Good, persistent head stand with color dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA.</appearance>
        <flavor>Hop flavor is typically medium-low to high, with qualities dependent on typical varieties used in the specific Specialty IPA. Hop bitterness is typically medium-high to very high, with qualities dependent on typical varieties used in the specific Specialty IPA. Malt flavor generally low to medium, with qualities dependent on typical varieties used in the specific Specialty IPA. Commonly will have a medium-dry to dry finish. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions. Various types of Specialty IPAs can show additional malt and yeast characteristics, depending on the type.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Some smooth alcohol warming can be sensed in stronger versions.</mouthfeel>

        <name>Specialty IPA: Belgian IPA</name>
        <impression>An IPA with the fruitiness and spiciness derived from the use of Belgian yeast. The examples from Belgium tend to be lighter in color and more attenuated, similar to a tripel that has been brewed with more hops. This beer has a more complex flavor profile and may be higher in alcohol than a typical IPA.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate to high hop aroma, often tropical, stone fruit, citrus or pine-like typical of American or New World hop varieties. Floral and spicy aromas are also found indicating European hops. Grassy aroma due to dry hopping may be present. Gentle, grainy-sweet malt aroma, with little to no caramel. Fruity esters are moderate to high and may include aromas of bananas, pears and apples. Light clove-like phenols may be noticeable. Belgian candi sugar-like aromas are sometimes present.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light golden to amber in color. Off-white head is moderate to large in size and has good retention. Clarity is fair to quite hazy in dry hopped examples.</appearance>
        <flavor>Initial flavor is moderately spicy and estery associated with Belgian yeast strains. Clove-like and peppery flavors are common. Banana, pear and apple flavors are also typical. Hop flavors are moderate to high in intensity and may reflect tropical, stone fruit, melon, citrusy, or piney American/New World varieties or floral and spicy Saazer-type hop flavors. Malt flavor is light and grainy-sweet, sometimes with low toasted or caramel malt flavor but not required. Bitterness is high and may be accentuated by spicy yeast-derived flavors. The finish is dry to medium-dry although some examples have a slight sweetness mixed with the lingering bitterness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>The body is medium to light and varies due to carbonation level and adjunct use. Carbonation level is medium to high. Some higher alcohol versions may be warming although this may not be readily apparent.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The choice of yeast strain and hop varieties is critical since many choices will horribly clash.</comments>
        <history>A relatively new style, started showing up in the mid 2000s. Homebrewers and microbreweries simply substituted Belgian yeast in their American IPA recipes. Belgian breweries added more hops to their tripel and pale ale recipes.</history>
        <ingredients>Belgian yeast strains used in making tripels and golden strong ales. American examples tend to use American or New World hops while Belgian versions tend to use European hops and only pale malt.</ingredients>
        <comparison>A cross between an American IPA/Imperial IPA with a Belgian Golden Strong Ale or Tripel. This style is may be spicier, stronger, drier and more fruity than an American IPA.</comparison>

        <impression>A beer with the dryness, hop-forward balance, and flavor characteristics of an American IPA, only darker in color - but without strongly roasted or burnt flavors. The flavor of darker malts is gentle and supportive, not a major flavor component. Drinkability is a key characteristic.</impression>
        <aroma>A moderate to high hop aroma, often with a stone fruit, tropical, citrusy, resinous, piney, berry, or melon character. If dry hopped, can have an additional floral, herbal, or grassy aroma, although this is not required. Very low to moderate dark malt aroma, which can optionally include light chocolate, coffee, or toast notes. Some clean or lightly caramelly malty sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either from esters or from hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from dark brown to black. Should be clear, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy; if opaque, should not be murky. Good head stand with light tan to tan color should persist.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium-low to high hop flavor with tropical, stone fruit, melon, citrusy, berry, piney or resinous aspects. Medium-high to very high hop bitterness, although dark malts may contribute to the perceived bitterness. The base malt flavor is generally clean and of low to medium intensity, and can optionally have low caramel or toffee flavors. Dark malt flavors are low to medium-low; restrained chocolate or coffee flavors may be present, but the roasted notes should not be intense, ashy, or burnt, and should not clash with the hops. Low to moderate fruitiness (from yeast or hops) is acceptable but not required. Dry to slightly off-dry finish. The finish may include a light roast character that contributes to perceived dryness, although this is not required. The bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without significant hop- or (especially) roasted malt-derived astringency. Dry-hopped versions may be a bit resiny. Medium carbonation. A bit of creaminess may be present but is not required. Some smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in stronger (but not all) versions.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most examples are standard strength. Strong examples can sometimes seem like big, hoppy porters if made too extreme, which hurts their drinkability. The hops and malt can combine to produce interesting interactions.</comments>
        <history>A variation of the American IPA style first commercially produced by Greg Noonan as Blackwatch IPA around 1990. Popularized in the Pacific Northwest and Southern California of the US starting in the early-mid 2000s. This style is sometimes known as Cascadian Dark Ale (CDA), mainly in the Pacific Northwest.</history>
        <ingredients>Debittered roast malts for color and some flavor without harshness and burnt qualities; American or New World hop varieties that don’t clash with roasted malts. Hop characteristics cited are typical of these type of hops; others characteristics are possible, particularly if derived from newer varietals.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Balance and overall impression of an American or Double IPA with restrained roast similar to the type found in Schwarzbiers. Not as roasty-burnt as American stouts and porters, and with less body and increased smoothness and drinkability.</comparison>

        <impression>Hoppy, bitter, and moderately strong like an American IPA, but with some caramel, chocolate, toffee, and/or dark fruit malt character as in an American Brown Ale. Retaining the dryish finish and lean body that makes IPAs so drinkable, a Brown IPA is a little more flavorful and malty than an American IPA without being sweet or heavy.</impression>
        <aroma>A moderate to moderately-strong fresh hop aroma featuring one or more characteristics of American or New World hops, such as tropical fruit, stone fruit, citrus, floral, spicy, berry, melon, pine, resinous, etc. Many versions are dry hopped and can have an additional fresh hop aroma; this is desirable but not required. Grassiness should be minimal, if present. A medium-low to medium malty-sweet aroma mixes in well with the hop selection, and often features chocolate, nuts, dark caramel, toffee, toasted bread, and/or dark fruit character. Fruitiness from yeast may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is also acceptable. A restrained alcohol note may be present, but this character should be minimal at best. Any American or New World hop character is acceptable; new hop varieties continue to be released and should not constrain this style.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from reddish-brown to dark brown but not black. Frequently opaque, but should be clear if visible. Unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Medium-sized, cream-colored to tan head with good persistence.</appearance>
        <flavor>Hop flavor is medium to high, and should reflect an American or New World hop character, such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc. Medium-high to high hop bitterness. Malt flavor should be medium-low to medium, and is generally clean but malty-sweet up front with milk chocolate, cocoa, toffee, nutty, biscuity, dark caramel, toasted bread and/or dark fruit malt flavors. The character malt choices and the hop selections should complement and enhance each other, not clash. The level of malt flavor should nearly balance the hop bitterness and flavor presentation. Low yeast-derived fruitiness is acceptable but not required. Dry to medium finish; residual sweetness should be medium-low to none. The bitterness and hop flavor may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. A very light, clean alcohol flavor may be noted in stronger versions. No roasted, burnt, or harsh-bitter malt character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency. Very light, smooth alcohol warming not a fault if it does not intrude into overall balance.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Previously might have been a sub-genre of American Brown Ales, hoppier and stronger than the normal products, but still maintaining the essential drinkability by avoiding sweet flavors or a heavy body or finish. The hops and malt can combine to produce interesting interactions.</comments>
        <history>A more modern craft beer name for a style that has long been popular with US homebrewers, when it was known as a hoppier American Brown Ale or sometimes Texas Brown Ale (despite origins in California).</history>
        <ingredients>Similar to an American IPA, but with medium or dark crystal malts, lightly roasted chocolate-type malts, or other intermediate color character malts. May use sugar adjuncts, including brown sugar. American or New World finishing hops with tropical, fruity, citrusy, piney, berry, or melon aspects; the choice of hops and character malts is synergistic - they very much have to complement each other and not clash.</ingredients>
        <comparison>A stronger and more bitter version of an American Brown Ale, with the balance of an American IPA.</comparison>

        <history>A modern American craft beer style, based on American IPA but with the malt flavors of an American Amber Ale.</history>
        <ingredients>Similar to an American IPA, but with medium or dark crystal malts, possibly some character malts with a light toasty aspect. May use sugar adjuncts. American or New World finishing hops with tropical, fruity, citrusy, piney, berry, or melon aspects; the choice of hops and character malts is synergistic - they very much have to complement each other and not clash.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar to the difference between an American Amber Ale and an American Pale Ale, a Red IPA will differ from an American IPA with the addition of some darker crystal malts giving a slightly sweeter, more caramelly and dark fruit-based balance. A Red IPA differs from an American Strong Ale in that the malt profile is less intense and there is less body; a Red IPA still has an IPA balance and doesn’t trend towards a barleywine-like malt character. A Red IPA is like a stronger, hoppier American Amber Ale, with the characteristic dry finish, medium-light body, and strong late hop character.</comparison>

        <comments>A modern American craft beer variation of American IPA. Rye malt character should be noticeable, otherwise enter in American IPA. Oak is inappropriate in this style; if noticeably oaked, enter in wood-aged category.</comments>
        <history>Looking to add complexity and variety to their IPAs, craft brewers and homebrewers substituted rye malt for a portion of their base malt. Rye IPAs, RyePAs or RIPAs have found a place in many craft breweries seasonal rotations.</history>
        <ingredients>Pale ale or 2-row brewers malt as the base, 15-20% Rye malt, American or New World hops, American or English yeast with a clean or slightly fruity profile. Generally all-malt, but mashed at lower temperatures for high attenuation. Sugar additions to aid attenuation are acceptable. Water character varies from soft to moderately sulfate. Restrained use of crystal malts, if any, as high amounts can lead to a sweet finish and clash with the hop character.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Drier and slightly spicier than an American IPA. Bitterness and spiciness from rye lingers longer than an American IPA. Does not have the intense rye malt character of a Roggenbier. Some examples are stronger like a Double IPA.</comparison>

      <notes>This category includes modern American strong ales with a varying balance of malt and hops. The category is defined mostly by alcohol strength and a lack of roast.</notes>

        <name>Double IPA</name>
        <impression>An intensely hoppy, fairly strong pale ale without the big, rich, complex maltiness and residual sweetness and body of an American barleywine. Strongly hopped, but clean, dry, and lacking harshness. Drinkability is an important characteristic; this should not be a heavy, sipping beer.</impression>
        <aroma>A prominent to intense hop aroma that typically showcases American or New World hop characteristics (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). Most versions are dry hopped and can have an additional resinous or grassy aroma, although this is not absolutely required. Some clean malty sweetness may be found in the background. Fruitiness, either from esters or hops, may also be detected in some versions, although a neutral fermentation character is typical. Some alcohol can usually be noted, but it should not have a “hot” character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from golden to light orange-copper; most modern versions are fairly pale. Good clarity, although unfiltered dry-hopped versions may be a bit hazy. Moderate-sized, persistent, white to off-white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Hop flavor is strong and complex, and can reflect the characteristics of modern American or New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, melon, etc.). High to absurdly high hop bitterness. Low to medium malt flavor, generally clean and grainy-malty although low levels of caramel or toasty flavors are acceptable. Low to medium fruitiness is acceptable but not required. A long, lingering bitterness is usually present in the aftertaste but should not be harsh. Dry to medium-dry finish; should not finish sweet or heavy. A light, clean, smooth alcohol flavor is not a fault. Oak is inappropriate in this style. May be slightly sulfury, but most examples do not exhibit this character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, with a smooth texture. Medium to medium-high carbonation. No harsh hop-derived astringency. Restrained, smooth alcohol warming acceptable.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A showcase for hops, yet remaining quite drinkable. The adjective “double" is arbitrary and simply implies a stronger version of an IPA; “imperial,” “extra,” “extreme,” or any other variety of adjectives would be equally valid, although the modern American market seems to have now coalesced around the “double” term.</comments>
        <history>An American craft beer innovation first developed in the mid-late 1990s reflecting the trend of American craft brewers “pushing the envelope” to satisfy the need of hop aficionados for increasingly intense products. Became more mainstream and popular throughout the 2000s, and inspired additional IPA creativity.</history>
        <ingredients>Clean 2-row malt is typical as a base grain; an excessively complex grist can be distracting. Crystal-type malts often muddy the hop flavors, and are generally considered undesirable in significant quantities. Sugar or other highly fermentable adjuncts are often used to increase attenuation, as are lower-temperature mash rests. Can use a complex variety of hops, typically American or New World, often with cutting-edge profiles providing distinctive differences. Modern hops with unusual characteristics are not out of style. American yeast that can give a clean or slightly fruity profile.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Bigger than either an English or American IPA in both alcohol strength and overall hop level (bittering and finish). Less malty, lower body, less rich and a greater overall hop intensity than an American Barleywine. Typically not as high in gravity/alcohol as a barleywine, since high alcohol and malt tend to limit drinkability.</comparison>

        <name>American Strong Ale</name>
        <impression>A strong, full-flavored American ale that challenges and rewards the palate with full malty and hoppy flavors and substantial bitterness. The flavors are bold but complementary, and are stronger and richer than average-strength pale and amber American ales.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium to high hop aroma, most often presenting citrusy or resiny notes although characteristics associated with other American or New World varieties may be found (tropical, stone fruit, melon, etc.). Moderate to bold maltiness supports hop profile, with medium to dark caramel a common presence, bready or toasty possible and background notes of light roast and/or chocolate noticeable in some examples. Generally exhibits clean to moderately fruity ester profile. Moderate alcohol aromatics may be noticeable, but should not be hot, harsh, or solventy.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium amber to deep copper or light brown. Moderate-low to medium-sized off-white to light tan head; may have low head retention. Good clarity. Alcohol level and viscosity may present “legs” when glass is swirled.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to high dextrinous malt with a full range of caramel, toffee, dark fruit flavors. Low to medium toasty, bready, or Maillard-rich malty flavors are optional, and can add complexity. Medium-high to high hop bitterness. The malt gives a medium to high sweet impression on the palate, although the finish may be slightly sweet to somewhat dry. Moderate to high hop flavor. Low to moderate fruity esters. The hop flavors are similar to the aroma (citrusy, resiny, tropical, stone fruit, melon, etc.). Alcohol presence may be noticeable, but sharp or solventy alcohol flavors are undesirable. Roasted malt flavors are allowable but should be a background note; burnt malt flavors are inappropriate. While strongly malty on the palate, the finish should seem bitter to bittersweet. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. The aftertaste typically has malt, hops, and alcohol noticeable.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to full body. An alcohol warmth may be present, but not be excessively hot. Any astringency present should be attributable to bold hop bitterness and should not be objectionable on the palate. Medium-low to medium carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A fairly broad style that can describe beers labeled in various ways, including modern Double/Imperial Red/Amber Ales and other strong, malty-but-hoppy beers that aren’t quite in the Barleywine class. Diverse enough to include what may be viewed as a strong American Amber Ale with room for more interpretations of other “Imperial” versions of lower gravity American Ale styles. Many “East Coast” type IPAs might fit better in this category if they have considerable crystal malt or otherwise more of a malty-sweet finish.</comments>
        <history>While modern craft versions were developed as “imperial” strength versions of American amber or red ales, the style has much in common with historic American stock ales. Strong, malty beers were highly hopped to keep as provision beers prior to prohibition. There is no continuous legacy of brewing stock ales in this manner, but the resemblance is considerable. Stone Arrogant Bastard was born out of a batch of pale ale that was mistakenly made with excess ingredients, thus creating what may have been the prototype for the imperial amber/red ale. Great Lakes first brewed Nosferatu in the early 1990s and called it a stock ale, although they now call it an imperial red ale. So whether by direct historical inspiration or by accident, the style developed independently in the craft beer era and has subsequently become quite popular.</history>
        <ingredients>Well-modified pale malt as a base; some character malts would be appropriate, medium to dark crystal malts are typical. Citrusy or piney American hops are common, although any American or New World varieties can be used in quantity, provided they do not clash with the malt character. Generally uses an attenuative American yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Generally not as strong and as rich as an American Barleywine. More malt balanced than an American or Double IPA with more American hop intensity than an English Strong Ale style would tolerate.</comparison>

        <impression>A well-hopped American interpretation of the richest and strongest of the English ales. The hop character should be evident throughout, but does not have to be unbalanced. The alcohol strength and hop bitterness often combine to leave a very long finish.</impression>
        <aroma>Hop character moderate to assertive and often showcases citrusy, fruity, or resiny New World varieties (although other varieties, such as floral, earthy or spicy English varieties or a blend of varieties, may be used). Rich maltiness, with a character that may be sweet, caramelly, bready, or fairly neutral. Low to moderately-strong fruity esters and alcohol aromatics. However, the intensity of aromatics often subsides with age. Hops tend to be nearly equal to malt in the aroma, with alcohol and esters far behind.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color may range from light amber to medium copper; may rarely be as dark as light brown. Often has ruby highlights. Moderately-low to large off-white to light tan head; may have low head retention. May be cloudy with chill haze at cooler temperatures, but generally clears to good to brilliant clarity as it warms. The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass lens. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in “legs” when beer is swirled in a glass.</appearance>
        <flavor>Strong, rich malt flavor with a noticeable hop flavor and bitterness in the balance. Moderately-low to moderately-high malty sweetness on the palate, although the finish may be somewhat sweet to quite dry (depending on aging). Hop bitterness may range from moderately strong to aggressive. While strongly malty, the balance should always seem bitter. Moderate to high hop flavor (any variety, but often showing a range of New World hop characteristics). Low to moderate fruity esters. Noticeable alcohol presence, but well-integrated. Flavors will smooth out and decline over time, but any oxidized character should be muted (and generally be masked by the hop character). May have some bready or caramelly malt flavors, but these should not be high; roasted or burnt malt flavors are inappropriate.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture (although the body may decline with long conditioning). Alcohol warmth should be noticeable but smooth. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Sometimes known as “Barley Wine” or “Barleywine style ale” (the latter due to legal requirements, not brewery preference).</comments>
        <history>Usually the strongest ale offered by a brewery, often associated with the winter or holiday season and vintage-dated. As with many American craft beer styles, derived from English examples but using American ingredients and featuring a much more forward hop profile. One of the first American craft beer versions was Anchor Old Foghorn, first brewed in 1975. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983, set the standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called and said, “your barleywine is too bitter” - to which Sierra Nevada replied, “thank you.”</history>
        <ingredients>Well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist. Some specialty or character malts may be used. Dark malts should be used with great restraint, if at all, as most of the color arises from a lengthy boil. New World hops are common, although any varieties can be used in quantity. Generally uses an attenuative American ale yeast.</ingredients>
        <comparison>The American version of the Barleywine tends to have a greater emphasis on hop bitterness, flavor and aroma than the English Barleywine, and often features American hop varieties. Typically paler than the darker English Barleywines (and lacking in the deeper malt flavors) but darker than the golden English Barleywines. Differs from a Double IPA in that the hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is fuller and often richer. An American Barleywine typically has more residual sweetness than a Double IPA, which affects the overall drinkability (sipping vs. drinking).</comparison>

        <impression>A richly textured, high alcohol sipping beer with a significant grainy, bready flavor and sleek body. The emphasis is first on the bready, wheaty flavors with interesting complexity from malt, hops, fruity yeast character and alcohol complexity.</impression>
        <aroma>Hop aroma is mild and can represent just about any late hop aromatic. Moderate to moderately-strong bready, wheaty malt character, often with additional malt complexity such as honey and caramel. A light, clean, alcohol aroma may noted. Low to medium fruity notes may be apparent. Very low levels of diacetyl are acceptable but not required. Weizen yeast character (banana/clove) is inappropriate.</aroma>
        <appearance>Color ranges from gold to deep amber, often with garnet or ruby highlights. Low to medium off-white head. The head may have creamy texture, and good retention. Chill haze is allowable, but usually clears up as the beer gets warmer. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible in “legs” when beer is swirled in a glass.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate to moderately-high wheaty malt flavor, dominant in the flavor balance over any hop character. Low to moderate bready, toasty, caramel, or honey malt notes are a welcome complexity note, although not required. Hop flavor is low to medium, and can reflect any variety. Moderate to moderately-high fruitiness, often with a dried-fruit character. Hop bitterness may range from low to moderate; balance therefore ranges from malty to evenly balanced. Should not be syrupy and under-attenuated. Some oxidative or vinous flavors may be present, as are light alcohol notes that are clean and smooth but complex. A complementary, supportive oak character is welcome, but not required.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-full to full bodied and chewy, often with a luscious, velvety texture. Low to moderate carbonation. Light to moderate smooth alcohol warming may also be present.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Dark malts should be used with restraint. Much of the color arises from a lengthy boil. Some commercial examples may be larger than the Vital Statistics, and some may not be brewed every year.</comments>
        <history>A relatively recent American craft beer style that was first brewed at the Rubicon Brewing Company in 1988. Often a winter seasonal, vintage, or one-off release. Breweries frequently experiment with this style, leading to a range of interpretations.</history>
        <ingredients>Typically brewed with a combination of American two-row and American wheat. Style commonly uses 50% or more wheat malt. Any variety of hops may be used. May be oak-aged.</ingredients>
        <comparison>More than simply a wheat-based barleywine, many versions have very expressive fruity and hoppy notes, while others develop complexity through oak aging. Less emphasis on the hops than American Barleywine. Has roots in American Wheat Beer rather than any German wheat styles, so should not have any German weizen yeast character.</comparison>

      <name>European Sour Ale</name>
      <notes>This category contains the traditional sour beer styles of Europe that are still produced, many (but not all) with a wheat component. Most have low bitterness, with the sourness of the beer providing the balance that hop bitterness would otherwise contribute. Some are sweetened or flavored, whether at the brewery or upon consumption.</notes>

        <name>Berliner Weisse</name>
        <impression>A very pale, refreshing, low-alcohol German wheat beer with a clean lactic sourness and a very high carbonation level. A light bread dough malt flavor supports the sourness, which shouldn’t seem artificial. Any <em>Brettanomyces</em> funk is restrained.</impression>
        <aroma>A sharply sour character is dominant (moderate to moderately-high). Can have up to a moderately fruity character (often lemony or tart apple). The fruitiness may increase with age and a light flowery character may develop. No hop aroma. The wheat may present as uncooked bread dough in fresher versions; combined with the acidity, may suggest sourdough bread. May optionally have a restrained funky <em>Brettanomyces</em> character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Very pale straw in color. Clarity ranges from clear to somewhat hazy. Large, dense, white head with poor retention. Always effervescent.</appearance>
        <flavor>Clean lactic sourness dominates and can be quite strong. Some complementary doughy, bready or grainy wheat flavor is generally noticeable. Hop bitterness is undetectable; sourness provides the balance rather than hops. Never vinegary. A restrained citrusy-lemony or tart apple fruitiness may be detected. Very dry finish. Balance dominated by sourness, but some malt flavor should be present. No hop flavor. May optionally have a restrained funky <em>Brettanomyces</em> character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light body. Very high carbonation. No sensation of alcohol. Crisp, juicy acidity.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>In Germany, it is classified as a <em>Schankbier</em> denoting a small beer of starting gravity in the range 7-8 °P. Often served with the addition of a shot of sugar syrups <em>(mit schuss)</em> flavored with raspberry <em>(himbeer)</em>, woodruff <em>(waldmeister)</em>, or Caraway schnapps <em>(Kümmel)</em> to counter the substantial sourness. Has been described by some as the most purely refreshing beer in the world.</comments>
        <history>A regional specialty of Berlin; referred to by Napoleon's troops in 1809 as “the Champagne of the North” due to its lively and elegant character. At one point, it was smoked and there used to be Märzen-strength (14 °P) version. Increasingly rare in German, but some American craft breweries now regularly produce the style.</history>
        <ingredients>Wheat malt content is typically 50% of the grist (as is tradition with all German wheat beers) with the remainder typically being Pilsner malt. A symbiotic fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and <em>Lactobacillus</em> (various strains) provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during fermentation and by extended cool aging. Hop bitterness is non-existent. Decoction mashing with mash hopping is traditional. German brewing scientists believe that <em>Brettanomyces</em> is essential to get the correct flavor profile, but this character is never strong.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Compared to a lambic, is generally not as acidic and has a clean lactic sourness with restrained to below sensory threshold funk. Also lower in alcohol content.</comparison>

        <name>Flanders Red Ale</name>
        <impression>A sour, fruity, red wine-like Belgian-style ale with interesting supportive malt flavors and fruit complexity. The dry finish and tannin completes the mental image of a fine red wine.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex fruity-sour profile with supporting malt that often gives a wine-like impression. Fruitiness is high, and reminiscent of black cherries, oranges, plums or red currants. There are often low to medium-low vanilla and/or chocolate notes. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. The sour aroma ranges from balanced to intense. Prominent vinegary acetic character is inappropriate. No hop aroma. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep red, burgundy to reddish-brown in color. Good clarity. White to very pale tan head. Average to good head retention.</appearance>
        <flavor>Intense fruitiness commonly includes plum, orange, black cherry or red currant flavors. A mild vanilla and/or chocolate character is often present. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. Sour flavor ranges from complementary to intense, and can have an acidic bite. Malty flavors range from complementary to prominent, and often have a soft toasty-rich quality. Generally as the sour character increases, the malt character blends to more of a background flavor (and vice versa). No hop flavor. Restrained hop bitterness. An acidic, tannic bitterness is often present in low to moderate amounts, and adds an aged red wine-like character and finish. Prominent vinegary acetic character is inappropriate. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor. Balanced to the malt side, but dominated by the fruity, sour, wine-like impression.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium bodied. Low to medium carbonation. Low to medium astringency, like a well-aged red wine, often with a prickly acidity. Deceivingly light and crisp on the palate although a somewhat sweet finish is not uncommon.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Long aging and blending of young and well-aged beer often occurs, adding to the smoothness and complexity, though the aged product is sometimes released as a connoisseur’s beer. Known as the Burgundy of Belgium, it is more wine-like than any other beer style. The reddish color is a product of the malt although an extended, less-than-rolling portion of the boil may help add an attractive Burgundy hue. Aging will also darken the beer. The Flanders red is more acetic (but never vinegar-like) and the fruity flavors more reminiscent of a red wine than an Oud Bruin. Can have an apparent attenuation of up to 98%.</comments>
        <history>An indigenous beer of West Flanders, typified by the products of the Rodenbach brewery, established in 1820 in West Flanders but reflective of earlier brewing traditions. The beer is aged for up to two years, often in huge oaken barrels which contain the resident bacteria necessary to sour the beer. It was once common in Belgium and England to blend old beer with young to balance the sourness and acidity found in aged beer. While blending of batches for consistency is now common among larger breweries, this type of blending is a fading art.</history>
        <ingredients>A base of Vienna and/or Munich malts, light to medium cara-malts, and a small amount of Special B are used with up to 20% maize. Low alpha acid continental hops are commonly used (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces, Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation and eventual flavor.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Less malty-rich than an Oud Bruin, often with more of a fruity-tart profile.</comparison>

        <impression>A malty, fruity, aged, somewhat sour Belgian-style brown ale.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex combination of fruity esters and rich malt character. Medium to medium-high esters commonly reminiscent of raisins, plums, figs, dates, black cherries or prunes. Medium low to medium high malt character of caramel, toffee, orange, treacle or chocolate. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. A sherry-like character may be present and generally denotes an aged example. A low sour aroma may be present, and can modestly increase with age but should not grow to a noticeable acetic/vinegary character. Hop aroma absent. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Dark reddish-brown to brown in color. Good clarity. Average to good head retention. Ivory to light tan head color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Malty with fruity complexity and typically some caramel character. Medium to medium-high fruitiness commonly includes dark or dried fruit such as raisins, plums, figs, dates, black cherries or prunes. Medium low to medium high malt character of caramel, toffee, orange, treacle or chocolate. Spicy phenols can be present in low amounts for complexity. A slight sourness often becomes more pronounced in well-aged examples, along with some sherry-like character, producing a “sweet-and-sour” profile. The sourness should not grow to a notable acetic/vinegary character. Hop flavor absent. Restrained hop bitterness. Low oxidation is appropriate as a point of complexity. Diacetyl is perceived only in very minor quantities, if at all, as a complementary flavor. Balance is malty, but with fruitiness and sourness present. Sweet and tart finish</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation. No astringency.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Long aging and blending of young and aged beer may occur, adding smoothness and complexity and balancing any harsh, sour character. This style was designed to lay down so examples with a moderate aged character are considered superior to younger examples. As in fruit lambics, Oud Bruin can be used as a base for fruit-flavored beers such as <em>kriek</em> (cherries) or <em>frambozen</em> (raspberries), though these should be entered in the <em>Classic-Style Fruit Beer</em> category.</comments>
        <history>An “old ale” tradition, indigenous to East Flanders, typified by the products of the Liefman brewery (now owned by Riva), which has roots back to the 1600s. Historically brewed as a “provision beer” that would develop some sourness as it aged. These beers were typically more sour than current commercial examples. While Flanders red beers are aged in oak, the brown beers are warm aged in stainless steel.</history>
        <ingredients>A base of Pils malt with judicious amounts of dark cara malts and a tiny bit of black or roast malt. Often includes maize. Low alpha acid continental hops are typical (avoid high alpha or distinctive American hops). Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus (and acetobacter) contribute to the fermentation and eventual flavor. Lactobacillus reacts poorly to elevated levels of alcohol. Water high in carbonates is typical of its home region and will buffer the acidity of darker malts and the lactic sourness. Magnesium in the water accentuates the sourness.</ingredients>
        <comparison>A deeper malt character distinguishes these beers from Flanders red ales. The Oud Bruin is less acetic and maltier than a Flanders Red, and the fruity flavors are more malt-oriented.</comparison>

        <name>Lambic</name>
        <impression>A fairly sour, often moderately funky wild Belgian wheat beer with sourness taking the place of hop bitterness in the balance. Traditionally spontaneously fermented in the Brussels area and served uncarbonated, the refreshing acidity makes for a very pleasant café drink.</impression>
        <aroma>A decidedly sour aroma is often dominant in young examples, but may become more subdued with age as it blends with aromas described as barnyard, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket. A mild citrus-fruity aroma is considered favorable. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. Older versions are commonly fruity with aromas of apples or even honey. No hop aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to deep golden in color; age tends to darken the beer. Clarity is hazy to good. Younger versions are often cloudy, while older ones are generally clear. White colored head generally has poor retention.</appearance>
        <flavor>Young examples are often noticeably lactic-sour, but aging can bring this character more in balance with the malt, wheat and barnyard characteristics. Fruity flavors are simpler in young lambics and more complex in the older examples, where they are reminiscent of apples or other light fruits, rhubarb, or honey. Some citrus flavor (often grapefruit) is occasionally noticeable, and is desirable. The malt and wheat character are typically low with some bready-grainy notes. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is low to none, and generally undetectable; sourness provides the balance. Typically has a dry finish. No hop flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from feeling like water. As a rule of thumb, lambic dries with age, which makes dryness a reasonable indicator of age. Has a medium to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Traditional versions are virtually to completely uncarbonated, but bottled examples can pick up moderate carbonation with age.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Straight lambics are single-batch, unblended beers. Since they are unblended, the straight lambic is often a true product of the “house character” of a brewery and will be more variable than a gueuze. They are generally served young (6 months) and on tap as cheap, easy-drinking beers without any filling carbonation. Younger versions tend to be one-dimensionally sour since a complex Brett character often takes upwards of a year to develop. An enteric character is often indicative of a lambic that is too young. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. Since the wild yeast and bacteria will ferment ALL sugars, they are typically bottled only when they have completely fermented.</comments>
        <history>Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing tradition several centuries old. The number of producers is constantly dwindling.</history>
        <ingredients>Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used. The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditionally these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately oaken barrels. The barrels used are neutral with little oak character, so don’t expect a fresh or forward oak character - more neutral is typical. Home-brewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast commonly including <em>Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus</em> and <em>Lactobacillus</em> in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley. Cultures taken from bottles are sometimes used but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still viable.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Generally has a more simple sourness and complexity than a gueuze. Traditionally served uncarbonated from pitchers, while gueuze is bottled and very highly carbonated.</comparison>
        <examples>The only bottled version readily available is Cantillon Grand Cru Bruocsella of whatever single batch vintage the brewer deems worthy to bottle. De Cam sometimes bottles their very old (5 years) lambic. In and around Brussels there are specialty cafes that often have draught lambics from traditional brewers or blenders such as Boon, De Cam, Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, Lindemans, Timmermans and Girardin.</examples>

        <name>Gueuze</name>
        <impression>A complex, pleasantly sour but balanced wild Belgian wheat beer that is highly carbonated and very refreshing. The spontaneous fermentation character can provide a very interesting complexity, with a wide range of wild barnyard, horse blanket, or leather characteristics intermingling with citrusy-fruity flavors and acidity.</impression>
        <aroma>A moderately sour aroma blends with aromas described as barnyard, leather, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket. While some may be more dominantly sour, balance is the key and denotes a better gueuze. Commonly fruity with aromas of citrus fruits (often grapefruit), apples or other light fruits, rhubarb, or honey. A very mild oak aroma is considered favorable. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. No hop aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>Golden color, with excellent clarity and a thick, rocky, mousse-like, white head that seems to last forever. Always effervescent.</appearance>
        <flavor>A moderately sour character is classically in balance with the malt, wheat and barnyard characteristics. A low, complementary sweetness may be present but higher levels are not traditional. While some may be more dominantly sour, balance is the key and denotes a better gueuze. A varied fruit flavor is common, and can have a honey-like character. A mild vanilla and/or oak flavor is occasionally noticeable. The malt is generally low and bready-grainy. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is generally absent but a very low hop bitterness may occasionally be perceived; sourness provides most of the balance. Crisp, dry, and tart finish. No hop flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from feeling like water. Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions have a light warming character. Highly carbonated.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Gueuze is traditionally produced by mixing one, two, and three-year old lambic. “Young” lambic contains fermentable sugars while old lambic has the characteristic “wild” taste of the Senne River valley. A noticeable vinegary or cidery character is considered a fault by Belgian brewers. A good gueuze is not the most pungent, but possesses a full and tantalizing bouquet, a sharp aroma, and a soft, velvety flavor. Lambic is served uncarbonated, while gueuze is served effervescent. Products marked <em>oude</em> or <em>ville</em> are considered most traditional.</comments>
        <history>Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing and blending tradition several centuries old. The number of producers is constantly dwindling and some producers are untraditionally sweetening their products (post-fermentation) to make them more palatable to a wider audience. These guidelines describe the traditional dry product.</history>
        <ingredients>Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used. The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate.

        <name>Fruit Lambic</name>
        <impression>A complex, fruity, pleasantly sour, wild wheat ale fermented by a variety of Belgian microbiota, and showcasing the fruit contributions blended with the wild character. The type of fruit can sometimes be hard to identify as fermented and aged fruit characteristics can seem different from the more recognizable fresh fruit aromas and flavors.</impression>
        <aroma>The specified fruit should be the dominant aroma. A low to moderately sour character blends with aromas described as barnyard, earthy, goaty, hay, horsey, and horse blanket (and thus should be recognizable as a lambic). The fruit aroma commonly blends well with the other aromas. An enteric, smoky, cigar-like, or cheesy aroma is unfavorable. No hop aroma.</aroma>
        <appearance>The variety of fruit generally determines the color, although lighter-colored fruit may have little effect on the color. The color intensity may fade with age. Clarity is often good, although some fruit will not drop bright. A thick rocky, mousse-like head, sometimes a shade of fruit, is generally long-lasting (carbonation-dependent). Carbonation is typically high, but must be specified.</appearance>
        <flavor>The specified fruit should be evident. Low to moderately sour flavor, often with an acidic bite in the finish. The classic barnyard characteristics may be low to high. When young, the beer will present its full fruity taste. As it ages, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit character—thus fruit lambics are not intended for long aging. The finish is commonly dry and tart, but a low, complementary sweetness may be present; higher sweetness levels are not traditional but can be included for personal preference (sweetness level must be specified). A mild vanilla and/or oak flavor is occasionally noticeable. An enteric, smoky or cigar-like character is undesirable. Hop bitterness is generally absent; acidity provides the balance. No hop flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium-light body. In spite of the low finishing gravity, the many mouth-filling flavors prevent the beer from tasting like water. Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions have a light warming character. Carbonation can vary from sparkling to nearly still (must be specified).</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Fruit-based lambics are often produced like gueuze by mixing one, two, and three-year old lambic. “Young” lambic contains fermentable sugars while old lambic has the characteristic “wild” taste of the Senne River valley. Fruit is commonly added halfway through aging and the yeast and bacteria will ferment all sugars from the fruit. Fruit may also be added to unblended lambic. The most traditional styles of fruit lambics include <em>kriek</em> (cherries), <em>framboise</em> (raspberries) and <em>druivenlambik</em> (muscat grapes). IBUs are approximate since aged hops are used; Belgians use hops for anti-bacterial properties more than bittering in lambics.</comments>
        <history>Spontaneously fermented wild ales from the area in and around Brussels (the Senne Valley) stem from a farmhouse brewing and blending tradition several centuries old. The number of producers is constantly dwindling and some are untraditionally sweetening their products (post-fermentation) with sugar or sweet fruit to make them more palatable to a wider audience. Fruit was traditionally added to lambic or gueuze, either by the blender or publican, to increase the variety of beers available in local cafes.</history>
        <ingredients>Unmalted wheat (30-40%), Pilsner malt and aged hops (3 years) are used. The aged hops are used more for preservative effects than bitterness, and makes actual bitterness levels difficult to estimate. Traditional products use 10-30% fruit (25%, if cherry). Fruits traditionally used include tart cherries (with pits), raspberries or Muscat grapes. More recent examples include peaches, apricots or merlot grapes. Tart or acidic fruit is traditionally used as its purpose is not to sweeten the beer but to add a new dimension. Traditionally these beers are spontaneously fermented with naturally occurring yeast and bacteria in predominately oaken barrels. The barrels used are old and have little oak character, so don’t expect a fresh or forward oak character - more neutral is typical. Home-brewed and craft-brewed versions are more typically made with pure cultures of yeast commonly including Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus in an attempt to recreate the effects of the dominant microbiota of Brussels and the surrounding countryside of the Senne River valley. Cultures taken from bottles are sometimes used but there is no simple way of knowing what organisms are still viable.</ingredients>
        <comparison>A lambic with fruit, not just a fruit beer; the wild lambic character must be evident.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>The <em>type of fruit</em> used <strong>must</strong> be specified. The brewer <strong>must</strong> declare a <em>carbonation</em> level (low, medium, high) and a <em>sweetness</em> level (low/none, medium, high).</entryinstructions>

        <impression>A refreshing, elegant, tasty, moderate-strength wheat-based ale.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate malty sweetness (often with light notes of honey and/or vanilla) with light, grainy, spicy wheat aromatics, often with a bit of tartness. Moderate perfumy coriander, often with a complex herbal, spicy, or peppery note in the background. Moderate zesty, citrusy-orangey fruitiness. A low spicy-herbal hop aroma is optional, but should never overpower the other characteristics. Vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like aromas are inappropriate. Spices should blend in with fruity, floral and sweet aromas and should not be overly strong.</aroma>
        <appearance>Very pale straw to very light gold in color. The beer will be very cloudy from starch haze and/or yeast, which gives it a milky, whitish-yellow appearance. Dense, white, moussy head. Head retention should be quite good.</appearance>
        <flavor>Pleasant malty-sweet grain flavor (often with a honey and/or vanilla character) and a zesty, orange-citrusy fruitiness. Refreshingly crisp with a dry, often tart, finish. Can have a low bready wheat flavor. Optionally has a very light lactic-tasting sourness. Herbal-spicy flavors, which may include coriander and other spices, are common should be subtle and balanced, not overpowering. A spicy-earthy hop flavor is low to none, and if noticeable, never gets in the way of the spices. Hop bitterness is low to medium-low, and doesn’t interfere with refreshing flavors of fruit and spice, nor does it persist into the finish. Bitterness from orange pith should not be present. Vegetal, celery-like, ham-like, or soapy flavors are inappropriate.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, often having a smoothness and light creaminess from unmalted wheat and the occasional oats. Despite body and creaminess, finishes dry and often a bit tart. Effervescent character from high carbonation. Refreshing, from carbonation, light acidity, and lack of bitterness in finish. No harshness or astringency from orange pith. Should not be overly dry and thin, nor should it be thick and heavy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The presence, character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies. Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be fragile and does not age well, so younger, fresher, properly handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.</comments>
        <history>A 400-year-old Belgian beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden, and has grown steadily in popularity over time, both with modern craft brewers and mass-market producers who see it as a somewhat fruity summer seasonal beer.</history>
        <ingredients>About 50% unmalted wheat and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some versions, up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g., chamomile, cumin, cinnamon, Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the production of mild, spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation, or the actual addition of lactic acid, is done.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Low bitterness level with a balance similar to a Weissbier, but with spice and citrus character coming from additions rather than the yeast.</comparison>

        <name>Belgian Pale Ale</name>
        <impression>A moderately malty, somewhat fruity, easy-drinking, copper-colored Belgian ale that is somewhat less aggressive in flavor profile than many other Belgian beers. The malt character tends to be a bit biscuity with light toasty, honey-like, or caramelly components; the fruit character is noticeable and complementary to the malt. The bitterness level is generally moderate, but may not seem as high due to the flavorful malt profile.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate malt aroma, which can be a combination of toasty, biscuity, or nutty, possibly with a touch of light caramel or honey. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness with an orange- or pear-like character. Low to moderate strength hop character (spicy, herbal, or floral) optionally blended with background level peppery, spicy phenols. The hop character is lower in balance than the malt and fruitiness.</aroma>
        <appearance>Amber to copper in color. Clarity is very good. Creamy, rocky, white head often fades more quickly than other Belgian beers.</appearance>
        <flavor>Has an initial soft, smooth, moderately malty flavor with a variable profile of toasty, biscuity, nutty, light caramel and/or honey notes. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness, sometimes orange- or pear-like. Relatively light (medium-low to low) spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. The hop bitterness is medium-high to medium-low, and is optionally enhanced by low to very low amounts of peppery phenols. There is a dry to balanced finish, with hops becoming more pronounced in the aftertaste of those with a drier finish. Fairly well balanced overall, with no single component being high in intensity; malt and fruitiness are more forward initially with a supportive bitterness and drying character coming on late.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-light body. Smooth palate. Alcohol level is restrained, and any warming character should be low if present. Medium to medium-high carbonation.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most commonly found in the Flemish provinces of Antwerp and Brabant. Considered “everyday” beers (Category I). Compared to their higher alcohol Category S cousins, they are Belgian “session beers” for ease of drinking. Nothing should be too pronounced or dominant; balance is the key. Yeast character generally more subtle than many Belgian beers, with some of the fruitiness being hop-driven.</comments>
        <history>Produced by breweries with roots as far back as the mid-1700s, the most well-known examples were perfected after the Second World War with some influence from Britain, including hops and yeast strains.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner or pale ale malt contributes the bulk of the grist with (cara) Vienna and Munich malts adding color, body and complexity. Sugar is not commonly used as high gravity is not desired. Saazer-type hops, Styrian Goldings, East Kent Goldings or Fuggles are commonly used. Yeasts prone to moderate production of phenols are often used but fermentation temperatures should be kept moderate to limit this character.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Fairly similar to pale ales from England <em>(Strong Bitter</em> category), typically with a slightly different yeast character and a more varied malt profile. Less yeast character than many other Belgian beers, though.</comparison>

        <impression>A fairly strong, malt-accentuated, lagered artisanal beer with a range of malt flavors appropriate for the color. All are malty yet dry, with clean flavors and a smooth character.</impression>
        <aroma>Prominent malty sweetness, often with a complex, light to moderate intensity toasty-bready-rich malt character. Low to moderate esters. Little to no hop aroma (may be a bit spicy, peppery, or herbal). Paler versions will still be malty but will lack richer, deeper aromatics and may have a bit more hops. Generally quite clean, although stronger versions may have a light, spicy alcohol note as it warms.</aroma>
        <appearance>Three main variations exist (blond, amber and brown), so color can range from golden-blonde to reddish-bronze to chestnut brown. Clarity is brilliant to fair, although haze is not unexpected in this type of often unfiltered beer. Well-formed head, generally white to off-white (varies by beer color), average persistence.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to high malt flavor often with a toasty-rich, biscuity, toffee-like or light caramel-sweet character. Malt flavors and complexity tend to increase with beer color. Low to moderate esters and alcohol flavors. Medium-low hop bitterness provides some support, but the balance is always tilted toward the malt. Darker versions will have more of an initial malty-sweet impression than paler versions, but all should be malty in the palate and finish. The malt flavor lasts into the finish, which is medium-dry to dry, never cloying. Low to no hop flavor (spicy, peppery, or herbal), although paler versions can have slightly higher levels of herbal or spicy hop flavor (which can also come from the yeast). Smooth, well-lagered character, even if made with ale yeast. Aftertaste of malt (character appropriate for the color) with some dryness and light alcohol.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-light (lean) body, often with a smooth, creamy-silky character. Moderate to high carbonation. Moderate alcohol warming, but should be very smooth and never hot.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Three main variations are included in the style: the <strong>brown</strong> (<em>brune</em>), the <strong>blond</strong> (<em>blonde</em>), and the <strong>amber</strong> (<em>ambrée</em>). The darker versions will have more malt character, while the paler versions can have more hops (but still are malt-focused beers). A related style is Bière de Mars, which is brewed in March (Mars) for present use and will not age as well. Attenuation rates are in the 80-85% range. Some fuller-bodied examples exist, but these are somewhat rare. Age and oxidation in imports often increases fruitiness, caramel flavors, and adds corked and musty notes; these are all signs of mishandling, not characteristic elements of the style.</comments>
        <history>Name literally means "beer which has been kept or lagered." A traditional artisanal ale from Northern France brewed in early spring and kept in cold cellars for consumption in warmer weather. It is now brewed year-round.</history>
        <ingredients>The "cellar" character commonly described in literature is more of a feature of mishandled commercial exports than fresh, authentic products. The somewhat moldy character comes from the corks and/or oxidation in commercial versions, and is incorrectly identified as "musty" or "cellar-like." Base malts vary by beer color, but usually include pale, Vienna and Munich types. Darker versions will have richer malt complexity and sweetness from crystal-type malts. Sugar may be used to add flavor and aid in the dry finish. Lager or ale yeast fermented at cool ale temperatures, followed by long cold conditioning. Floral, herbal or spicy continental hops.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Related to the Belgian Saison style, the main difference is that the Bière de Garde is rounder, richer, malt-focused, and lacks the spicy, bitter character of a Saison.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>Entrant <strong>must</strong> specify <em>blond</em>, <em>amber</em>, or <em>brown</em> bière de garde. If no color is specified, the judge should attempt to judge based on initial observation, expecting a malt flavor and balance that matches the color.</entryinstructions>

      <notes>This category contains the pale, well-attenuated, balanced to bitter beers, often more driven by yeast character than malt flavors, with generally higher alcohol (although a range exists within styles).</notes>

        <name>Belgian Blond Ale</name>
        <impression>A moderate-strength golden ale that has a subtle fruity-spicy Belgian yeast complexity, slightly malty-sweet flavor, and dry finish.</impression>
        <aroma>Light earthy or spicy hop nose, along with a lightly grainy-sweet malt character. Shows a subtle yeast character that may include spicy phenolics, perfumy or honey-like alcohol, or yeasty, fruity esters (commonly orange-like or lemony). Light sweetness that may have a slightly sugar-like character. Subtle yet complex.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light to deep gold color. Generally very clear. Large, dense, and creamy white to off-white head. Good head retention with Belgian lace.</appearance>
        <flavor>Smooth, light to moderate grainy-sweet malt flavor initially, but finishes medium-dry to dry with some smooth alcohol becoming evident in the aftertaste. Medium hop and alcohol bitterness to balance. Light hop flavor, can be spicy or earthy. Very soft yeast character (esters and alcohols, which are sometimes perfumy or orange/lemon-like). Light spicy phenolics optional. Some lightly caramelized sugar or honey-like sweetness on palate.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-high to high carbonation, can give mouth-filling bubbly sensation. Medium body. Light to moderate alcohol warmth, but smooth. Can be somewhat creamy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Often has an almost lager-like character, which gives it a cleaner profile in comparison to many other Belgian styles. Belgians use the term <em>Blond</em>, while the French spell it <em>Blonde</em>. Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range. Many Trappist or artisanal Belgian beers are called <em>Blond</em> but those are not representative of this style.</comments>
        <history>Relatively recent development to further appeal to European Pils drinkers, becoming more popular as it is heavily marketed and widely distributed.</history>
        <ingredients>Belgian Pils malt, aromatic malts, sugar, Belgian yeast strains that produce complex alcohol, phenolics and perfumy esters, Saazer-type, Styrian Goldings, or East Kent Goldings hops. Spices are not traditionally used, although the ingredients and fermentation by-products may give an impression of spicing (often reminiscent of oranges or lemons). If spices are present, should be a background character only.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar strength as a Dubbel, similar character as a Belgian Strong Golden Ale or Tripel, although a bit sweeter and not as bitter.</comparison>

        <name>Saison</name>
        <impression>Most commonly, a pale, refreshing, highly-attenuated, moderately-bitter, moderate-strength Belgian ale with a very dry finish. Typically highly carbonated, and using non-barley cereal grains and optional spices for complexity, as complements the expressive yeast character that is fruity, spicy, and not overly phenolic. Less common variations include both lower-alcohol and higher-alcohol products, as well as darker versions with additional malt character.</impression>
        <aroma>Quite aromatic, with fruity, spicy, and hoppy characteristics evident. The esters can be fairly high (moderate to high), and are often reminiscent of citrus fruits such as oranges or lemons. The hops are low to moderate and are often spicy, floral, earthy, or fruity. Stronger versions can have a soft, spicy alcohol note (low intensity). Spicy notes are typically peppery rather than clove-like, and can be up to moderately-strong (typically yeast-derived). Subtle, complementary herb or spice additions are allowable, but should not dominate. The malt character is typically slightly grainy in character and low in intensity. Darker and stronger versions will have more noticeable malt, with darker versions taking characteristics associated with grains of that color (toasty, biscuity, caramelly, chocolate, etc.). In versions where sourness is present instead of bitterness, some of the sour character can be detected (low to moderate).</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale versions are often a distinctive pale orange but may be pale golden to amber in color (gold to amber-gold is most common). Darker versions may run from copper to dark brown. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to ivory head resulting in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass as it fades. Clarity is poor to good, though haze is not unexpected in this type of unfiltered beer. Effervescent.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium-low to medium-high fruity and spicy flavors, supported by a low to medium soft malt character, often with some grainy flavors. Bitterness is typically moderate to high, although sourness can be present in place of bitterness (both should not be strong flavors at the same time). Attenuation is extremely high, which gives a characteristic dry finish essential to the style; a Saison should never finish sweet. The fruity character is frequently citrusy (orange or lemon), and the spices are typically peppery. Allow for a range of balance in the fruity-spicy characteristics; this is often driven by the yeast selection. Hop flavor is low to moderate, and generally spicy or earthy in character. The balance is towards the fruity, spicy, hoppy character, with any bitterness or sourness not overwhelming these flavors. Darker versions will have more malt character, with a range of flavors derived from darker malts (toasty, bready, biscuity, chocolate, etc.) that support the fruity-spicy character of the beer (roasted flavors are not typical). Stronger versions will have more malt flavor in general, as well as a light alcohol impression. Herbs and spices are completely optional, but if present should be used in moderation and not detract from the yeast character. The finish is very dry and the aftertaste is typically bitter and spicy. The hop bitterness can be restrained, although it can seem accentuated due to the high attenuation levels.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light to medium body. Alcohol sensation varies with strength, from none in table version to light in standard versions, to moderate in super versions. However, any warming character should be fairly low. Very high carbonation with an effervescent quality. There is enough prickly acidity on the tongue to balance the very dry finish. In versions with sourness, a low to moderate tart character can add a refreshing bite, but not be puckering (optional).</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Variations exist in strength and color, but they all have similar characteristics and balance, in particularly the refreshing, highly-attenuated, dry character with high carbonation. There is no correlation between strength and color. The balance can change somewhat with strength and color variations, but the family resemblance to the original artisanal ale should be evident. Pale versions are likely to be more bitter and have more hop character, while darker versions tend to have more malt character and sweetness, yielding a more balanced presentations. Stronger versions often will have more malt flavor, richness, and body simply due to their higher gravity. Although they tend to be very well-attenuated, they may not be perceived to be as dry as standard-strength saisons due to their strength. The Saison yeast character is a must, although maltier and richer versions will tend to mask this character more. Often called <em>Farmhouse ales</em> in the US, but this term is not common in Europe where they are simply part of a larger grouping of <em>artisanal ales</em>.</comments>
        <history>A provision ale originally brewed in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium, for consumption during the active farming season. Originally a lower-alcohol product so as to not debilitate field workers, but tavern-strength products also existed. Higher-strength and different-colored products appeared after WWII. The best known modern saison, Saison Dupont, was first produced in the 1920s. Originally a rustic, artisanal ale made with local farm-produced ingredients, it is now brewed mostly in larger breweries yet retains the image of its humble origins.</history>
        <ingredients>Not typically spiced, with the yeast, hops and grain providing the character; but spices are allowed if they provide a complementary character. Continental base malts are typical, but the grist frequently contains other grains such as wheat, oats, rye, or spelt. Adjuncts such as sugar and honey can also serve to add complexity and dry out the beer. Darker versions will typically use richer, darker malts, but not typically roasted types. Saazer-type, Styrian or East Kent Golding hops are commonly used. A wide range of herbs or spices can add complexity and uniqueness, but should always meld well with the yeast and hop character. Brettanomyces is not typical for this style; Saisons with Brett should be entered in the <em>American Wild Ale</em> category.</ingredients>
        <comparison>At standard strengths and pale color (the most common variety), like a more highly-attenuated, hoppy, and bitter Belgian blond ale with a stronger yeast character. At super strength and pale color, similar to a Belgian tripel, but often with more of a grainy, rustic quality and sometimes with a spicier yeast character.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify the <em>strength</em> (table, standard, super) and the <em>color</em> (pale, dark).</entryinstructions>

        <name>Belgian Golden Strong Ale</name>
        <impression>A pale, complex, effervescent, strong Belgian-style ale that is highly attenuated and features fruity and hoppy notes in preference to phenolics.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex with significant fruity esters, moderate spiciness and low to moderate alcohol and hop aromas. Esters are reminiscent of lighter fruits such as pears, oranges or apples. Moderate to moderately low spicy, peppery phenols. A low to moderate yet distinctive perfumy, floral hop character is often present. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy and low-to-moderate in intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is light and slightly grainy-sweet to nearly neutral.</aroma>
        <appearance>Yellow to medium gold in color. Good clarity. Effervescent. Massive, long-lasting, rocky, often beady, white head resulting in characteristic Belgian lace on the glass as it fades.</appearance>
        <flavor>Marriage of fruity, spicy and alcohol flavors supported by a soft malt character. Esters are reminiscent of pears, oranges or apples. Low to moderately low phenols are peppery in character. A low to moderate spicy hop character is often present. Alcohols are soft and spicy, and are low-to-moderate in intensity. Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness leads to a dry finish with a low to moderately bitter aftertaste.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Very highly carbonated; effervescent. Light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. No hot alcohol or solventy character.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>References to the devil are included in the names of many commercial examples of this style, referring to their potent alcoholic strength and as a tribute to the original example (Duvel). The best examples are complex and delicate. High carbonation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>).</comments>
        <history>Originally developed by the Moortgat brewery after WWI as a response to the growing popularity of Pilsner beers.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner malt with substantial sugary adjuncts. Saazer-type hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used - those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols - often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Fairly soft water. Spicing is not traditional; if present, should be a background character only.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Strongly resembles a Tripel, but may be even paler, lighter-bodied and even crisper and drier; the drier finish and lighter body also serves to make the assertive hopping and yeast character more prominent. Tends to use yeast that favor ester development (particularly pome fruit) over spiciness in the balance.</comparison>

      <name>Trappist Ale</name>
      <notes><strong>Trappist</strong> is a protected legal appellation, and cannot be used commercially except by genuine Trappist monasteries that brew their own beer. However, we can use it to describe the type or styles of beer produced by those breweries and those who make beers of a similar style. Trappist type beers are all characterized by very high attenuation, high carbonation through bottle conditioning, and interesting (and often aggressive) yeast character.</notes>
      <subcategory id="26A">
        <name>Trappist Single</name>
        <impression>A pale, bitter, highly attenuated and well carbonated Trappist ale, showing a fruity-spicy Trappist yeast character, a spicy-floral hop profile, and a soft, supportive grainy-sweet malt palate.</impression>
        <aroma>Medium-low to medium-high Trappist yeast character, showing a fruity-spicy character along with medium-low to medium spicy or floral hops, occasionally enhanced by light herbal/citrusy spice additions. Low to medium-low grainy-sweet malt backdrop, which may have a light honey or sugar quality. Fruit expression can vary widely (citrus, pome fruit, stone fruit). Light spicy, yeast-driven phenolics found in the best examples. Bubblegum inappropriate.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to medium gold color. Generally good clarity, with a moderate-sized, persistent, billowy white head with characteristic lacing.</appearance>
        <flavor>Fruity, hoppy, bitter, and dry. Initial malty-sweet impression, with a grainy-sweet soft malt palate, and a dry, hoppy finish. The malt may have a light honeyed biscuit or cracker impression. Moderate spicy or floral hop flavor. Esters can be citrus (orange, lemon, grapefruit), pome fruit (apple, pear), or stone fruit (apricot, peach). Light to moderate spicy, peppery, or clove phenolics. Bitterness rises towards the crisp, dry finish, with an aftertaste of light malt, moderate hops and yeast character.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body. Smooth. Medium-high to high carbonation, can be somewhat prickly. Should not have noticeable alcohol warmth.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Often not labeled or available outside the monastery, or infrequently brewed. Might also be called monk’s beer or Brother’s beer. Highly attenuated, generally 85% or higher.</comments>
        <history>While Trappist breweries have a tradition of brewing a lower-strength beer as a monk’s daily ration, the bitter, pale beer this style describes is a relatively modern invention reflecting current tastes. Westvleteren first brewed theirs in 1999, but replaced older lower-gravity products.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner malt, Belgian Trappist yeast, Saazer-type hops.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a top-fermented Belgian/Trappist interpretation of a German Pils - pale, hoppy, and well-attenuated, but showing prototypical Belgian yeast character. Has less sweetness, higher attenuation, less character malt, and is more hop-centered than a Belgian Pale Ale. More like a much smaller, more highly hopped tripel than a smaller Belgian Blond Ale.</comparison>

        <impression>A deep reddish-copper, moderately strong, malty, complex Trappist ale with rich malty flavors, dark or dried fruit esters, and light alcohol blended together in a malty presentation that still finishes fairly dry.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex, rich-sweet malty aroma, possibly with hints of chocolate, caramel and/or toast (but never roasted or burnt aromas). Moderate fruity esters (usually including raisins and plums, sometimes also dried cherries). Esters sometimes include banana or apple. Spicy phenols and higher alcohols are common (may include light clove and spice, peppery, rose-like and/or perfumy notes). Spicy qualities can be moderate to very low. Alcohol, if present, is soft and never hot or solventy. Low to no spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma, typically absent. The malt is most prominent in the balance with esters and a touch of alcohol in support, blending together for a harmonious presentation.</aroma>
        <appearance>Dark amber to copper in color, with an attractive reddish depth of color. Generally clear. Large, dense, and long-lasting creamy off-white head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Similar qualities as aroma. Rich, complex medium to medium-full rich-sweet malt flavor on the palate yet finishes moderately dry. Complex malt, ester, alcohol and phenol interplay (raisiny flavors are common; dried fruit flavors are welcome; clove or pepper spiciness is optional). Balance is always toward the malt. Medium-low bitterness that doesn’t persist into the aftertaste. Low spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor is optional and not usually present.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-full body. Medium-high carbonation, which can influence the perception of body. Low alcohol warmth. Smooth, never hot or solventy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Most commercial examples are in the 6.5 - 7% ABV range. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>).</comments>
        <history>Originated at monasteries in the Middle Ages, and was revived in the mid-1800s after the Napoleonic era.</history>
        <ingredients>Belgian yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols, esters, and phenolics are commonly used. Impression of complex grain bill, although traditional versions are typically Belgian Pils malt with caramelized sugar syrup or other unrefined sugars providing much of the character. Saazer-type, English-type or Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. No spices are traditionally used, although restrained use is allowable (background strength only).</ingredients>
        <comparison>Should not be as malty as a bock and should not have crystal malt-type sweetness. Similar in strength and balance as a Belgian Blond, but with a richer malt and ester profile. Less strong and intense as a Belgian Dark Strong Ale.</comparison>

        <name>Belgian Tripel</name>
        <impression>A pale, somewhat spicy, dry, strong Trappist ale with a pleasant rounded malt flavor and firm bitterness. Quite aromatic, with spicy, fruity, and light alcohol notes combining with the supportive clean malt character to produce a surprisingly drinkable beverage considering the high alcohol level.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex bouquet with moderate to significant spiciness, moderate fruity esters and low alcohol and hop aromas. Generous spicy, peppery, sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters are often reminiscent of citrus fruits such as oranges, but may sometimes have a slight banana character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in intensity. The malt character is light, with a soft, slightly grainy-sweet or slightly honey-like impression. The best examples have a seamless, harmonious interplay between the yeast character, hops, malt, and alcohol.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity. Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in characteristic <em>Belgian lace</em> on the glass as it fades.</appearance>
        <flavor>Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a soft, rounded grainy-sweet malt impression, occasionally with a very light honey note. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character. Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes lemon, and are low to moderate. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy, and low in intensity. Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste with substantial spicy-fruity yeast character. The grainy-sweet malt flavor does not imply any residual sweetness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Highly carbonated. The alcohol content is deceptive, and has little to no obvious warming sensation. Always effervescent.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30 IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>).</comments>
        <history>Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at Westmalle.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner malt, typically with pale sugar adjuncts. Saazer-type hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used - those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics and higher alcohols - often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if used, should be a background character only. Fairly soft water.</ingredients>
        <comparison>May resemble a Belgian Golden Strong Ale but slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied, with more emphasis on phenolics and less on esters. Usually has a more rounded malt flavor but should never be sweet.</comparison>

        <name>Belgian Dark Strong Ale</name>
        <impression>A dark, complex, very strong Belgian ale with a delicious blend of malt richness, dark fruit flavors, and spicy elements. Complex, rich, smooth and dangerous.</impression>
        <aroma>Complex, with a rich-sweet malty presence, significant esters and alcohol, and an optional light to moderate spiciness. The malt is rich and strong, and can have a deep bready-toasty quality often with a deep caramel complexity. The fruity esters are strong to moderately low, and can contain raisin, plum, dried cherry, fig or prune notes. Spicy phenols may be present, but usually have a peppery quality not clove-like; light vanilla is possible. Alcohols are soft, spicy, perfumy and/or rose-like, and are low to moderate in intensity. Hops are not usually present (but a very low spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma is acceptable). No dark/roast malt aroma. No hot alcohols or solventy aromas.</aroma>
        <appearance>Deep amber to deep coppery-brown in color (<em>dark</em> in this context implies <em>more deeply colored than golden</em>). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light tan-colored head. Can be clear to somewhat hazy.</appearance>
        <flavor>Similar to aroma (same malt, ester, phenol, alcohol, and hop comments apply to flavor as well). Moderately malty-rich on the palate, which can have a sweet impression if bitterness is low. Usually moderately dry to dry finish, although may be up to moderately sweet. Medium-low to moderate bitterness; alcohol provides some of the balance to the malt. Generally malty-rich balance, but can be fairly even with bitterness. The complex and varied flavors should blend smoothly and harmoniously. The finish should not be heavy or syrupy.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>High carbonation but not sharp. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. Body can range from medium-light to medium-full and creamy. Most are medium-bodied.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Authentic Trappist versions tend to be drier (Belgians would say <em>more digestible</em>) than Abbey versions, which can be rather sweet and full-bodied. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (or <em>refermented in the bottle</em>). Sometimes known as a Trappist Quadruple, most are simply known by their strength or color designation.</comments>
        <history>Most versions are unique in character reflecting characteristics of individual breweries, produced in limited quantities and often highly sought-after.</history>
        <ingredients>Belgian yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols, esters, and sometimes phenolics are commonly used. Impression of a complex grain bill, although many traditional versions are quite simple, with caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars and yeast providing much of the complexity. Saazer-type, English-type or Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. Spices generally not used; if used, keep subtle and in the background.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a larger dubbel, with a fuller body and increased malt richness. Not as bitter or hoppy as a tripel, but of similar strength.</comparison>

      <notes>The Historical Beer category contains styles that either have all but died out in modern times, or that were much more popular in past times and are known only through recreations. This category can also be used for traditional or indigenous beers of cultural importance within certain countries. Placing a beer in the historical category does not imply that it is not currently being produced, just that it is a very minor style or perhaps is in the process of rediscovery by craft brewers.</notes>
      <notes><strong>Entry Instructions:</strong> The entrant must either specify a style with a BJCP-supplied description from the list below, or specify a different historical beer style that is not described elsewhere in these guidelines. In the case of a style that has changed substantially over the years (such as Porter or Stout), the entrant may specify an existing BJCP style as well as an era (e.g., 1820 English Porter). When the entrant specifies any style not on the BJCP-supplied list, the entrant must provide a description of the style for the judges in sufficient detail to allow the beer to be judged. If a beer is entered with just a style name and no description, it is very unlikely that judges will understand how to judge it. Currently defined examples: <em>Gose, Piwo Grodziskie, Lichtenhainer, Roggenbier, Sahti, Kentucky Common, Pre-Prohibition Lager, Pre-Prohibition Porter, London Brown</em>.</notes>

        <name>Historical Beer: Gose</name>
        <impression>A highly-carbonated, tart and fruity wheat ale with a restrained coriander and salt character and low bitterness. Very refreshing, with bright flavors and high attenuation.</impression>
        <aroma>Light to moderately fruity aroma of pome fruit. Light sourness, slightly sharp. Noticeable coriander, which can have an aromatic lemony quality, and an intensity up to moderate. Light bready, doughy, yeasty character like uncooked sourdough bread. The acidity and coriander can give a bright, lively impression. The salt may be perceived as a very light, clean sea breeze character or just a general freshness, if noticeable at all.</aroma>
        <appearance>Unfiltered, with a moderate to full haze. Moderate to tall sized white head with tight bubbles and good retention. Effervescent. Medium yellow color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate to restrained but noticeable sourness, like a squeeze of lemon in iced tea. Moderate bready/doughy malt flavor. Light to moderate fruity character of pome fruit, stone fruit, or lemons. Light to moderate salt character, up to the threshold of taste; the salt should be noticeable (particularly in the initial taste) but not taste overtly salty. Low bitterness, no hop flavor. Dry, fully-attenuated finish, with acidity not hops balancing the malt. Acidity can be more noticeable in the finish, and enhance the refreshing quality of the beer. The acidity should be balanced, not forward (although historical versions could be very sour).</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>High to very high carbonation, effervescent. Medium-light to medium-full body. Salt may give a slightly tingly, mouthwatering quality, if perceived at all. The yeast and wheat can give it a little body, but it shouldn’t have a heavy feel.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Served in traditional cylindrical glasses. Historical versions may have been more sour than modern examples due to spontaneous fermentation, and may be blended with syrups as is done with Berliner Weisse, or <em>Kümmel</em>, a liqueur flavored with caraway, cumin, and fennel. Modern examples are inoculated with lactobacillus, and are more balanced and generally don’t need sweetening. Pronounced <em>GOH-zeh</em>.</comments>
        <history>Minor style associated with Leipzig but originating in the Middle Ages in the town of Goslar on the Gose River. Documented to have been in Leipzig by 1740. Leipzig was said to have 80 Gose houses in 1900. Production declined significantly after WWII, and ceased entirely in 1966. Modern production was revived in the 1980s, but the beer is not widely available.</history>
        <ingredients>Pilsner and wheat malt, restrained use of salt and coriander seed, lactobacillus. The coriander should have a fresh, citrusy (lemon or bitter orange), bright note, and not be vegetal, celery-like, or ham-like. The salt should have a sea salt or fresh salt character, not a metallic, iodine note.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Perceived acidity is not as intense as Berliner Weisse or Gueuze. Restrained use of salt, coriander, and lactobacillus - should not taste overtly salty. Coriander aroma can be similar to a witbier. Haziness similar to a Weissbier.</comparison>

        <name>Historical Beer: Kentucky Common</name>
        <impression>A darker-colored, light-flavored, malt-accented beer with a dry finish and interesting character malt flavors. Refreshing due to its high carbonation and mild flavors, and highly sessionable due to being served very fresh and with restrained alcohol levels.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to medium grainy, corn-like or sweet maltiness with a low toast, biscuity-grainy, bready, or caramel malt accent. Medium to moderately-low hop aroma, usually floral or spicy in character. Clean fermentation character, with possible faint berry ester. Low levels of DMS are acceptable. No sourness. Malt-forward in the balance.</aroma>
        <appearance>Amber-orange to light brown in color. Typically clear, but may have some light haze due to limited conditioning. Foam stand may not be long lasting, and is usually white to beige in color.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderate grainy-sweet maltiness with low to medium-low caramel, toffee, bready, and/or biscuity notes. Generally light palate flavors typical of adjunct beers; a low grainy, corn-like sweetness is common. Medium to low floral or spicy hop flavor. Medium to low hop bitterness, which should neither be coarse nor have a harsh aftertaste. May exhibit light fruitiness. Balance in the finish is towards the malt. May have a lightly flinty or minerally-sulfate flavor in the finish. The finish is fairly dry, including the contributions of roasted grains and minerals. No sourness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-light body with a relatively soft mouthfeel. Highly carbonated. Can have a creamy texture.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Modern characterizations of the style often mention a lactic sourness or sour mashing, but extensive brewing records from the larger breweries at the turn of the century have no indication of long acid rests, sour mashing, or extensive conditioning. This is likely a modern homebrewer invention, based on the supposition that since indigenous Bourbon distillers used a sour mash, beer brewers must also have used this process. No contemporaneous records indicate sour mashing or that the beer had a sour profile; rather the opposite, that the beer was brewed as an inexpensive, present-use ale. Enter soured versions in <em>American Wild Ale</em>.</comments>
        <history>A true American original style, Kentucky Common was almost exclusively produced and sold around the Louisville Kentucky metropolitan area from some time after the Civil War up to Prohibition. Its hallmark was that it was inexpensive and quickly produced, typically 6 to 8 days from mash to delivery. The beer was racked into barrels while actively fermenting (1.020 - 1.022) and tightly bunged to allow carbonation in the saloon cellar. There is some speculation that it was a variant of the lighter common or cream ale produced throughout much of the East prior to the Civil War and that the darker grains were added by the mostly Germanic brewers to help acidify the typical carbonate water of the Louisville area, or that they had a preference for darker colored beers. Up until the late 19th century, Kentucky Common was not brewed in the summer months unless cellars, usually used for malting, were used for fermentation. With the advent of ice machines, the larger breweries were able to brew year round. In the period from 1900 to prohibition, about 75% of the beer sold in the Louisville area was Kentucky Common. With prohibition, the style died completely as the few larger breweries that survived were almost exclusively lager producers.</history>
        <ingredients>Six-row barley malt was used with 35% corn grits to dilute the excessive protein levels along with 1 to 2% each caramel and black malt. Native American hops, usually about .2 pounds per barrel of Western hops for bittering and a similar amount of New York hops (such as Clusters) for flavor (15 minutes prior to knock out). Imported continental Saazer-type hops (.1 pounds per barrel) were added at knock out for aroma. Water in the Louisville area was typically moderate to high in carbonates. Mash water was often pre-boiled to precipitate the carbonate and Gypsum was commonly added. Considering the time from mash in to kegging for delivery was typically 6 to 8 days, clearly aggressive top-fermenting yeasts was used.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Like a darker-colored cream ale emphasizing corn, but with some light character malt flavor. Malt flavors and balance are probably closest to modern adjunct-driven international amber or dark lagers, Irish red ales, or Belgian pale ales.</comparison>

        <impression>A sour, smoked, lower-gravity historical German wheat beer. Complex yet refreshing character due to high attenuation and carbonation, along with low bitterness and moderate sourness.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderately strong fresh smoky aroma, light hints of sourness, medium-low fruity esters, possibly apples or lemons, moderate bready-grainy malt. The smoke character is stronger than the bready notes, and the smoke has a ‘dry’ character, like the remnants of an old fire, not a ‘greasy’ smoke.</aroma>
        <appearance>Tall off-white head, rocky and persistent. Deep yellow to light gold color. Fair clarity, may be somewhat hazy.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately strong fruity flavor, possibly lemons or apples. Moderate intensity, clean lactic tartness (no funk). Similar smoky character as aroma (dry wood fire), medium strength. Dry finish, with acidity and smoke in the aftertaste. Low bitterness; the acidity is providing the balance, not hops. Fresh, clean palate and slightly puckery aftertaste. The wheat character is on the low side; the smoke and acidity are more prominent in the balance. The lemony-tart/green apple flavor is strongest in the finish, with smoke a close second. Complex.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Tingly acidity. High carbonation. Medium to medium-light body.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Served young. Smoke and sour is an unusual combination that is not for everyone.</comments>
        <history>Originating in Lichtenhain, in Thüringen (central Germany). Height of popularity was towards the end of the 1800s, and was widely available throughout Thüringen. Like a pre-1840 Berliner Weisse.</history>
        <ingredients>Smoked barley malt, wheat malt, lactobacillus, top-fermenting yeast. Grists vary, but the wheat would typically be 30-50%.</ingredients>
        <comparison>In the same general historical lower-alcohol top-fermenting central European wheat beer family as Gose, Grodziskie, and Berliner weisse, has elements of all of them but having its own unique balance - sour and smoke is not found in any of the other beers. Not as acidic as Berliner weisse, probably more like a smoked Gose without coriander and salt, or a Grodziskie with Gose-like acidity.</comparison>

        <name>Historical Beer: London Brown Ale</name>
        <impression>A luscious, sweet, malt-oriented dark brown ale, with caramel and toffee malt complexity and a sweet finish.</impression>
        <aroma>Moderate malty-sweet aroma, often with a rich, caramel or toffee-like character. Low to medium fruity esters, often dark fruit like plums. Very low to no hop aroma, earthy or floral qualities.</aroma>
        <appearance>Medium to very dark brown color, but can be nearly black. Nearly opaque, although should be relatively clear if visible. Low to moderate off-white to tan head.</appearance>
        <flavor>Deep, caramel or toffee-like malty and sweet flavor on the palate and lasting into the finish. Hints of biscuit and coffee are common. Some fruity esters can be present (typically dark fruit); relatively clean fermentation profile for an English ale. Low hop bitterness. Hop flavor is low to non-existent, possibly earthy or floral in character. Moderately-low to no perceivable roasty or bitter black malt flavor. Moderately sweet finish with a smooth, malty aftertaste. May have a sugary-sweet flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body, but the residual sweetness may give a heavier impression. Medium-low to medium carbonation. Quite creamy and smooth in texture, particularly for its gravity.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Increasingly rare; Mann’s has over 90% market share in Britain, but in an increasingly small segment. Always bottled. Frequently used as a sweet mixer with cask mild and bitter in pubs. Commercial versions can be pasteurized and back-sweetened, which gives more of a sugary-sweet flavor.</comments>
        <history>Developed by Mann’s as a bottled product in 1902. Claimed at the time to be “the sweetest beer in London.” Pre-WWI versions were around 5% ABV, but same general balance. Declined in popularity in second half of 20th century, and now nearly extinct.</history>
        <ingredients>English pale ale malt as a base with a healthy proportion of darker caramel malts and often some roasted (black) malt and wheat malt (this is Mann’s traditional grist - others can rely on dark sugars for color and flavor). Moderate to high carbonate water. English hop varieties are most authentic, though with low flavor and bitterness almost any type could be used. Post-fermentation sweetening with lactose or artificial sweeteners, or sucrose (if pasteurized).</ingredients>
        <comparison>May seem somewhat like a less roasty version of a sweet stout (and lower-gravity, at least for US sweet stout examples) or a sweet version of a dark mild.</comparison>

        <name>Historical Beer: Piwo Grodziskie</name>
        <impression>A low-gravity, highly-carbonated, light-bodied ale combining an oak-smoked flavor with a clean hop bitterness. Highly sessionable.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to moderate oak wood smoke is the most prominent aroma component, but can be subtle and hard to detect. A low spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma is typically present, and should be lower than or equal to the smoke in intensity. Hints of grainy wheat are also detected in the best examples. The aroma is otherwise clean, although light pome fruit esters (especially ripe red apple or pear) are welcome. No acidity. Slight water-derived sulfury notes may be present.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to medium gold in color with excellent clarity. A tall, billowy, white, tightly-knit head with excellent retention is distinctive. Murkiness is a fault.</appearance>
        <flavor>Moderately-low to medium oak smoke flavor up front which carries into the finish; the smoke can be stronger in flavor than in aroma. The smoke character is gentle, should not be acrid, and can lend an impression of sweetness. A moderate to strong bitterness is readily evident which lingers through the finish. The overall balance is toward bitterness. Low but perceptible spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor. Low grainy wheat character in the background. Light pome fruit esters (red apple or pear) may be present. Dry, crisp finish. No sourness.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Light in body, with a crisp and dry finish. Carbonation is quite high and can add a slight carbonic bite or prickly sensation. No noticeable alcohol warmth.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Pronounced in English as “pivo grow-JEES-kee-uh” (meaning: Grodzisk beer). Known as Grätzer (pronounced “GRATE-sir”) in German-speaking countries, and in some beer literature. Traditionally made using a multi-step mash, a long boil (~2 hours), and multiple strains of ale yeast. The beer is never filtered but Isinglass is used to clarify before bottle conditioning. Traditionally served in tall conical glassware to accommodate the vigorous foam stand.</comments>
        <history>Developed as a unique style centuries ago in the Polish city of Grodzisk (known as Grätz when ruled by Prussia and Germany). Its fame and popularity rapidly extended to other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20&gt;th century. Regular commercial production declined after WWII and ceased altogether in the early-mid 1990s. This style description describes the traditional version during its period of greatest popularity.</history>
        <ingredients>Grain bill usually consists entirely of oak-smoked wheat malt. Oak-smoked wheat malt has a different (and less intense) smoke character than German beechwood-smoked barley malt; it has a drier, crisper, leaner quality - a bacon/ham smoke flavor is inappropriate. Saazer-type hops (Polish, Czech or German), moderate hardness sulfate water, and a relatively clean and attenuative continental ale yeast fermented at moderate ale temperatures are traditional. German hefeweizen yeast or other strains with a phenol or strong ester character are inappropriate.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar in strength to a Berliner Weisse, but never sour. Has a smoked character but less intense than in a Rauchbier.</comparison>

        <name>Historical Beer: Pre-Prohibition Lager</name>
        <impression>A clean, refreshing, but bitter pale lager, often showcasing a grainy-sweet corn flavor. All malt or rice-based versions have a crisper, more neutral character. The higher bitterness level is the largest differentiator between this style and most modern mass-market pale lagers, but the more robust flavor profile also sets it apart.</impression>
        <aroma>Low to medium grainy, corn-like or sweet maltiness may be evident (although rice-based beers are more neutral). Medium to moderately high hop aroma, with a range of character from rustic to floral to herbal/spicy; a fruity or citrusy modern hop character is inappropriate. Clean lager character. Low DMS is acceptable. May show some yeast character, as with modern American lagers; allow for a range of subtle supporting yeast notes.</aroma>
        <appearance>Yellow to deep gold color. Substantial, long lasting white head. Bright clarity.</appearance>
        <flavor>Medium to medium-high maltiness with a grainy flavor, and optionally a corn-like roundness and impression of sweetness. Substantial hop bitterness stands up to the malt and lingers through the dry finish. All malt and rice-based versions are often crisper, drier, and generally lack corn-like flavors. Medium to high hop flavor, with a rustic, floral, or herbal/spicy character. Medium to high hop bitterness, which should neither be overly coarse nor have a harsh aftertaste. Allow for a range of lager yeast character, as with modern American lagers, but generally fairly neutral.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body with a moderately rich, creamy mouthfeel. Smooth and well-lagered. Medium to high carbonation levels.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The classic American Pilsner was brewed both pre-Prohibition and post-Prohibition with some differences. OGs of 1.050-1.060 would have been appropriate for pre-Prohibition beers while gravities dropped to 1.044-1.048 after Prohibition. Corresponding IBUs dropped from a pre-Prohibition level of 30-40 to 25-30 after Prohibition.</comments>
        <history>A version of Pilsner brewed in the USA by immigrant German brewers who brought the process and yeast with them, but who had to adapt their recipes to work with native hops and malt. This style died out after Prohibition but was resurrected by homebrewers in the 1990s. Few commercial versions are made, so the style still remains mostly a homebrew phenomenon.</history>
        <ingredients>Six-row barley with 20% to 30% flaked maize (corn) or rice to dilute the excessive protein levels; modern versions may be all malt. Native American hops such as Clusters, traditional continental hops, or modern noble-type crosses are also appropriate. Modern American hops such as Cascade are inappropriate. Water with a high mineral content can lead to an unpleasant coarseness in flavor and harshness in aftertaste. A wide range of lager yeast character can be exhibited, although modern versions tend to be fairly clean.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Similar balance and bitterness as modern Czech Premium Pale Lagers, but exhibiting native American grains and hops from the era before US Prohibition. More robust, bitter, and flavorful than modern American pale lagers, and often with higher alcohol.</comparison>

        <impression>A dunkelweizen made with rye rather than wheat, but with a greater body and light finishing hops.</impression>
        <aroma>Light to moderate spicy rye aroma intermingled with light to moderate weizen yeast aromatics (spicy clove and fruity esters, either banana or citrus). Light spicy, floral, or herbal hops are acceptable.</aroma>
        <appearance>Light coppery-orange to very dark reddish or coppery-brown color. Large creamy off-white to tan head, quite dense and persistent (often thick and rocky). Cloudy, hazy appearance.</appearance>
        <flavor>Grainy, moderately-low to moderately-strong spicy rye flavor, often having a hearty flavor reminiscent of rye or pumpernickel bread. Medium to medium-low bitterness allows an initial malt sweetness (sometimes with a bit of caramel) to be tasted before yeast and rye character takes over. Low to moderate weizen yeast character (banana, clove), although the balance can vary. Medium-dry, grainy finish with a lightly bitter (from rye) aftertaste. Low to moderate spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor acceptable, and can persist into aftertaste.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Medium to medium-full body. High carbonation. Moderately creamy.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Rye is a huskless grain and is difficult to mash, often resulting in a gummy mash texture that is prone to sticking. Rye has been characterized as having the most assertive flavor of all cereal grains. It is inappropriate to add caraway seeds to a roggenbier (as some American brewers do); the rye character is traditionally from the rye grain only.</comments>
        <history>A specialty German rye beer originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria. Never a widely popular style, it has all but disappeared in modern times.</history>
        <ingredients>Malted rye typically constitutes 50% or greater of the grist (some versions have 60-65% rye). Remainder of grist can include pale malt, Munich malt, wheat malt, crystal malt and/or small amounts of debittered dark malts for color adjustment. Weizen yeast provides distinctive banana esters and clove phenols. Light usage of Saazer-type hops in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Lower fermentation temperatures accentuate the clove character by suppressing ester formation. Decoction mash traditionally used (as with weissbiers).</ingredients>
        <comparison>A more distinctive variant of a dunkelweizen using malted rye instead of malted wheat. American Rye Beers will not have the weizen yeast character, and likely more hops.</comparison>

        <aroma>High banana esters with moderate to moderately-high clove-like phenolics. Not sour. May have a low to moderate juniper character. Grainy malt, caramel, and rye in background. Light alcohol aroma. Sweet malt impression.</aroma>
        <appearance>Pale yellow to dark brown color; most are medium to dark amber. Generally quite cloudy (unfiltered). Little head, due to low carbonation.</appearance>
        <flavor>Strong banana and moderate to moderately-high clove yeast character. Moderate grainy rye flavor. Low bitterness. Fairly sweet finish. Juniper can add a pine-like flavor; juniper berries can add a gin-like flavor; both should be complementary, not dominant. No noticeable hop flavor. Moderate caramel flavor but no roast. Multi-layered and complex, with kind of a wortiness that is unusual in other beer styles. Not sour.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Thick, viscous, and heavy with protein (no boil means no hot break). Nearly still to medium-low carbonation. Strongly warming from the alcohol level and young age, but often masked by sweetness.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The use of rye doesn’t mean that it should taste like caraway (a dominant flavor in rye bread). The use of juniper berries will give a flavor like gin (similarly flavored with juniper berries). The juniper acts a bit like hops in the balance and flavor, providing some counterpoint to the sweet malt.</comments>
        <history>An indigenous traditional style from Finland; a farmhouse tradition for at least 500 years, often brewed for festive occasions like summer weddings, and consumed within a week or two of brewing. A similar tradition exists in Estonia, where the beer is known as <em>koduolu</em>.</history>
        <ingredients>Malted barley along with malted and unmalted grains, often rye. Low hops. Juniper boughs used for lautering (traditionally in a hollowed-out log), but often producing a juniper/berry character. Often uses top-fermenting baker’s yeast in a fast, warm fermentation (German Weizen yeast is a good substitute). Not boiled; a long mash steep is used, with a separately added hop tea.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Strong resemblance to Weizenbocks, but sweet and thick with a rye and juniper character.</comparison>

      <name>American Wild Ale</name>
      <notes>The name <strong>American Wild Ale</strong> is in common use by craft brewers and homebrewers. However, the word <em>Wild</em> does not imply that these beers are necessarily spontaneously-fermented; rather, it indicates that they are influenced by microbes other than traditional brewer’s yeasts. This category is intended for a wide range of beers that do not fit traditional European sour or wild styles. All of the styles in this category are essentially specialty beers where many creative interpretations are possible, and the styles are defined only by the use of specific fermentation profiles and ingredients. As specialty styles, the mandatory description provided by the entrant is of the utmost importance to the judge.</notes>
      <notes>Throughout this category, Brett is used as an abbreviation for Brettanomyces. This is the term most craft brewers and homebrewers will use in conversation, if not in formal communications.</notes>
      <subcategory id="28A">
        <name>Brett Beer</name>
        <impression>Most often drier and fruitier than the base style suggests. Funky notes range from low to high, depending on the age of the beer and strain(s) of Brett used. Funkiness is generally restrained in younger 100% Brett examples, but tends to increase with age. May possess a light acidity, although this does not come from Brett.</impression>
        <aroma>Variable by base style. Young Brett-fermented beers will possess more fruity notes (e.g., tropical fruit, stone fruit, or citrus), but this is variable by the strain(s) of Brett used. For 100% Brett beers heavily hopped with American hop varieties, the fermentation-derived flavors are often difficult to tease from the hop aromatics. Older 100% Brett beers may start to develop a little funk (e.g., barnyard, wet hay, or slightly earthy or smoky notes), but this character should not dominate. If the beer is fermented with a brewer’s yeast in addition to Brett, some of the character of the primary yeast may remain. A faint sourness is acceptable but should not be a prominent character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Variable by base style. Clarity can be variable, and depends on the base style and ingredients used. Some haze is not necessarily a fault.</appearance>
        <flavor>Variable by base style. Brett character may range from minimal to aggressive. Can be quite fruity (e.g., tropical fruit, berry, stone fruit, citrus), or have some smoky, earthy, or barnyard character. Should not be unpleasantly funky, such as Band-Aid, fetid, nail polish remover, cheese, etc. Light sourness is acceptable with the beer being lightly tart, but should not be truly sour. Always fruitier when young, gaining more funk with age. May not be acetic or lactic. Malt flavors are often less pronounced than in the base style, leaving a beer most often dry and crisp due to high attenuation by the Brett.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Variable by base style. Generally a light body, lighter than what might be expected from the base style but an overly thin body is a fault. Generally moderate to high carbonation. Head retention is variable.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The base style describes most of the character of these beers, but the addition of Brett ensures a drier, thinner, and funkier product. Younger versions are brighter and fruitier, while older ones possess more depth of funk and may lose more of the base style character. Wood-aged versions should be entered in the Wild Specialty Beer style. The Brett character should always meld with the style; these beers should never be a ‘Brett bomb’. Note that Brett does not produce lactic acid.</comments>
        <history>Modern American craft beer interpretations of Belgian wild ales, or experimentations inspired by Belgian wild ales or historical English beers with Brett. 100% Brett beers gained popularity after the year 2000; Port Brewing Mo Betta Bretta was one of the first celebrated examples.</history>
        <ingredients>Virtually any style of beer, fermented in any manner, then finished with one or more strains of Brett. Alternatively, a beer made with Brett as the sole fermentation strain.</ingredients>
        <comparison>Compared to the same beer style without Brett, a Brett Beer will be drier, more highly attenuated, fruitier, lighter in body, and slightly funkier as it ages. Less sourness and depth than Belgian ‘wild’ ales.</comparison>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify either a base beer style (Classic Style, or a generic style family) or provide a description of the ingredients/specs/desired character. The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify if a 100% Brett fermentation was conducted. The entrant <strong>may</strong> specify the strain(s) of Brettanomyces used.</entryinstructions>

        <impression>A sour and/or funky version of a base style of beer.</impression>
        <aroma>Variable by base style. The contribution of non-Saccharomyces microbes should be noticeable to strong, and often contribute a sour and/or funky, wild note. The best examples will display a range of aromatics, rather than a single dominant character. The aroma should be inviting, not harsh or unpleasant.</aroma>
        <appearance>Variable by base style. Clarity can be variable; some haze is not a fault. Head retention can be poor due to high levels of acid or anti-foam properties of some lactobacillus strains.</appearance>
        <flavor>Variable by base style. Look for an agreeable balance between the base beer and the fermentation character. A range of results is possible from fairly high acidity/funk to a subtle, pleasant, harmonious beer. The best examples are pleasurable to drink with the esters and phenols complementing the malt and/or hops. The wild character can be prominent, but does not need to be dominating in a style with an otherwise strong malt/hop profile. Acidity should be firm yet enjoyable, but should not be biting or vinegary; prominent or objectionable/offensive acetic acid is a fault. Bitterness tends to be low, especially as sourness increases.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Variable by base style. Generally a light body, almost always lighter than what might be expected from the base style. Generally moderate to high carbonation, although often lower in higher alcohol examples.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>These beers may be aged in wood, but any wood character should not be a primary or dominant flavor. Sour beers are typically not bitter as these flavors clash. The base beer style becomes less relevant because the various yeast and bacteria tend to dominate the profile. Inappropriate characteristics include diacetyl, solvent, ropy/viscous texture, and heavy oxidation.</comments>

        <aroma>Variable by base style. Should show the fruit, sour and/or funk of a wild fermentation, as well as the characteristics of the special ingredients used. The best examples will blend the aromatics from the fermentation with the special ingredients, creating an aroma that may be difficult to attribute precisely.</aroma>
        <appearance>Variable by base style, generally showing a color, tint, or hue from any fruit (if used) in both the beer and the head. Clarity can be variable; some haze is not a fault. Head retention is often poor.</appearance>
        <flavor>Variable by base style. Should show the fruit, sour and/or funk of a wild fermentation, as well as the characteristics of the special ingredients used. Any fruit sweetness is generally gone, so only the esters typically remain from the fruit. The sour character from the fruit and wild fermentation could be prominent, but should not be overwhelming. The acidity and tannin from any fruit can both enhance the dryness of the beer, so care must be taken with the balance. The acidity should enhance the perception of the fruit flavor, not detract from it. Wood notes, if present, add flavor but should be balanced.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Variable by base style. Generally a light body, lighter than what might be expected from the base style. Generally moderate to high carbonation; carbonation should balance the base style if one is declared. The presence of tannin from some fruit or wood can provide a slight astringency, enhance the body, or make the beer seem drier than it is.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>A wild beer featuring fruit, herbs, spices, or wood based on a style other than lambic. Could be another Classic Style (normally sour or not), or something more generic. These beers may be aged in wood, but any wood character should not be a primary or dominant flavor.</comments>

      <name>Fruit Beer</name>
      <notes>The Fruit Beer category is for beer made with any fruit or combination of fruit under the definitions of this category. The <strong>culinary, not botanical,</strong> definition of fruit is used here - fleshy, seed-associated structures of plants that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state. Examples include pome fruit (apple, pear, quince), stone fruit (cherry, plum, peach, apricot, mango, etc.), berries (any fruit with the word ‘berry’ in it), currants, citrus fruit, dried fruit (dates, prunes, raisins, etc.), tropical fruit (banana, pineapple, guava, papaya, etc.), figs, pomegranate, prickly pear, and so on. It does not mean spices, herbs, or vegetables as defined in Category 30, especially botanical fruit treated as culinary vegetables. Basically, if you have to justify a fruit using the word “technically” as part of the description, then that’s not what we mean.</notes>

        <impression>A harmonious marriage of fruit and beer, but still recognizable as a beer. The fruit character should be evident but in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product.</impression>
        <aroma>The distinctive aromatics associated with the declared fruit should be noticeable in the aroma; however, note that some fruit (e.g., raspberries, cherries) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) - allow for a range of fruit character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. The additional aromatics should blend well with whatever aromatics are appropriate for the declared base beer style.</aroma>
        <appearance>Appearance should be appropriate for the declared base beer and declared fruit. For lighter-colored beers with fruits that exhibit distinctive colors, the color should be noticeable. Note that the color of fruit in beer is often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different shades. Fruit beers may have some haze or be clear, although haze is a generally undesirable. The head may take on some of the color of the fruit.</appearance>
        <flavor>As with aroma, the distinctive flavor character associated with the declared fruit should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The balance of fruit with the underlying beer is vital, and the fruit character should not be so artificial and/or inappropriately overpowering as to suggest a ‘fruit juice drink.’ Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation by-products, such as esters, should be appropriate to the base beer and be harmonious and balanced with the distinctive fruit flavors present. Remember that fruit generally add flavor not sweetness to fruit beers. The sugar found in fruit is usually fully fermented and contributes to lighter flavors and a drier finish than might be expected for the declared base style. However, residual sweetness is not necessarily a negative characteristic unless it has a raw, unfermented quality.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Mouthfeel may vary depending on the base beer selected and as appropriate to that base beer. Body and carbonation levels should be appropriate to the declared base beer style. Fruit generally adds fermentables that tend to thin out the beer; the resulting beer may seem lighter than expected for the declared base style. Smaller and darker fruit have a tendency to add a tannic depth that should overwhelm the base beer.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Overall balance is the key to presenting a well-made fruit beer. The fruit should complement the original style and not overwhelm it. The key attributes of the underlying style will be different with the addition of fruit; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version.

      <notes>We use the common or culinary definitions of spices, herbs, and vegetables, not botanical or scientific ones. In general, spices are the dried seeds, seed pods, fruit, roots, bark, etc. of plants used for flavoring food. Herbs are leafy plants or parts of plants (leaves, flowers, petals, stalks) used for flavoring foods. Vegetables are savory or less sweet edible plant products, used primarily for cooking or sometimes eating raw. Vegetables can include some botanical fruit. This category explicitly includes all culinary spices, herbs, and vegetables, as well as nuts (anything with ‘nut’ in the name, including coconut), chile peppers, coffee, chocolate, spruce tips, rose hips, hibiscus, fruit peels/zest (but not juice), rhubarb, and the like. It does not include culinary fruit or grains. Flavorful fermentable sugars and syrups (agave nectar, maple syrup, molasses, sorghum, treacle, honey, etc.) can be included only in combination with other allowable ingredients, and should not have a dominant character. Any combination of allowable ingredients may also be entered. See Category 29 for a definition and examples of fruit.</notes>

        <notes><strong>Autumn Seasonal Beers</strong> are beers that suggest cool weather and the autumn harvest season, and may include pumpkin or other squashes, and the associated spices.

        <impression>An amber to copper, spiced beer that often has a moderately rich body and slightly warming finish suggesting a good accompaniment for the cool fall season, and often evocative of Thanksgiving traditions.</impression>
        <aroma>A wide range of aromatics is possible, although many examples are reminiscent of pumpkin pie, candied yams, or similar harvest or (US) Thanksgiving themed dishes. Any combination of aromatics that suggests the fall season is welcome. The base beer style often has a malty profile that supports the balanced presentation of the aromatics from spices and possibly other special ingredients. Additional fermentables (e.g., brown sugar, honey, molasses, maple syrup, etc.) may lend their own unique aromatics. Hop aromatics are often absent, subdued, or slightly spicy. Alcohol aromatics may be found in some examples, but this character should be restrained. The overall aroma should be balanced and harmonious, and is often fairly complex and inviting.</aroma>
        <appearance>Generally medium amber to coppery-brown (lighter versions are more common). Usually clear, although darker versions may be virtually opaque. Some chill haze is acceptable. Generally has a well-formed head that is often off-white to tan. Some versions with squashes will take on an unusual hue for beer, with orange-like hints.</appearance>
        <flavor>Many interpretations are possible; allow for brewer creativity as long as the resulting product is balanced and provides some spice (and optionally, sugar and vegetable) presentation. Spices associated with the fall season are typical (as mentioned in the Aroma section). The spices and optional fermentables should be supportive and blend well with the base beer style. Rich, malty and/or sweet malt-based flavors are common, and may include caramel, toasty, biscuity, or nutty flavors (toasted bread crust or cooked pie crust flavors are welcome). May include distinctive flavors from specific fermentables (molasses, honey, brown sugar, etc.), although these elements are not required. Flavor derived from squash-based vegetables are often elusive. The wide range of special ingredients should be supportive and balanced, not so prominent as to overshadow the base beer. Bitterness and hop flavor are generally restrained so as to not interfere with the spices and special ingredients. Generally finishes rather full and satisfying, and often has some alcohol flavor. Roasted malt characteristics are typically absent.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>A wide range of interpretations is possible. Body is generally medium to full, and a certain malty and/or vegetable-based chewiness is often present. Moderately low to moderately high carbonation is typical. Many examples will show some well-aged, warming alcohol content, but without being overly hot. The beers do not have to be overly strong to show some warming effects.</mouthfeel>

        <history>Throughout history, beer of a somewhat higher alcohol content and richness has been enjoyed during the winter holidays, when old friends get together to enjoy the season. Many breweries produce unique seasonal offerings that may be darker, stronger, spiced, or otherwise more characterful than their normal beers. Spiced versions are an American or Belgian tradition, since English or German breweries traditionally do not use spices in their beer.</history>

      <name>Alternative Fermentables Beer</name>
      <notes>This category contains specialty beers that have some additional ingredient (grain or sugar) that adds a distinctive character.</notes>
      <subcategory id="31A">
        <name>Alternative Grain Beer</name>
        <notes>An <strong>Alternative Fermentables Beer</strong> is a standard beer (Classic Style or not) with additional or non-standard brewing grains (e.g., rye, oats, buckwheat, spelt, millet, sorghum, rice, etc.) added or used exclusively. Gluten-free (GF) beers made from completely gluten-free ingredients may be entered here, while GF beers using process-based gluten removal should be entered in their respective base style categories.</notes>
        <notes>See the <em>Introduction to Specialty-Type Beer</em> section for additional comments, particularly on evaluating the balance of added ingredients with the base beer.</notes>
        <impression>A base beer enhanced by or featuring the character of additional grain or grains. The specific character depends greatly on the character of the added grains.</impression>
        <aroma>Same as base beer style. The added grain will lend a particular character, although with some grains the beer will simply seem a bit more grainy or nutty. The alternative grain should provide the major aroma profile for this beer.</aroma>
        <appearance>Same as base beer style, although some additional haze may be noticeable.</appearance>
        <flavor>Same as base beer style. The additional grain should be noticeable in flavor, although it may not be necessarily identifiable. However, the alternative grain should provide the major flavor profile for this beer. Different grains have different characters; the additional grain should enhance the flavor of the base beer. Many will add an additional grainy, bready, or nutty flavor.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Same as the base beer, although many additional grains will tend to increase the body (oats, rye) and increase the viscosity, while some may decrease the body (GF grains) resulting in thinness.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>If the alternative grain does not provide a noticeable distinguishable character to the beer, enter it as the base style. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative grain is fundamental to the style definition (e.g., Rye IPA, Oatmeal Stout, Rice- or Corn-based International Lager). Note that sake is not beer, and is not intended for this category.</comments>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify a base style, but the declared style does not have to be a <em>Classic Style</em>. The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify the type of alternative grain used.</entryinstructions>

        <name>Alternative Sugar Beer</name>
        <notes>An <strong>Alternative Fermentables Beer</strong> is a standard beer (Classic Style or not) with additional fermentable sugars (e.g., honey, brown sugar, invert sugar, molasses, treacle, maple syrup, sorghum, etc.) added.</notes>
        <notes>See the <em>Introduction to Specialty-Type Beer</em> section for additional comments, particularly on evaluating the balance of added ingredients with the base beer.</notes>

        <aroma>Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (honey, molasses, etc.) may add an aroma component. Whatever additional aroma component is present should be in balance with the beer components, and be a pleasant combination.</aroma>
        <appearance>Same as the base beer, although some sugars will bring additional colors.</appearance>
        <flavor>Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (honey, molasses, etc.) may add a flavor component. Whatever additional flavor component is present should be in balance with the beer components, and be a pleasant combination. Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some added sugars will have unfermentable elements that may provide a fuller finish; fully fermentable sugars may thin out the finish.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Same as the base beer, although depending on the type of sugar added, could increase or decrease the body.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>If the additional fermentables do not add a distinguishable character to the beer, enter it in the base style category. A honey-based beer should not have so much honey that it reads more like a mead with beer (i.e., a braggot) than a honey beer. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative sugar is fundamental to the style definition, or where a small amount of neutral-flavored sugar is used simply to increase gravity, increase attenuation, or lighten flavor or body; those beers should be entered as the normal base style.</comments>

      <name>Smoked Beer</name>
      <notes>This category contains specialty beers that have a smoke character.</notes>
      <subcategory id="32A">
        <name>Classic Style Smoked Beer</name>
        <impression>A smoke-enhanced beer showing good balance between the smoke and beer character, while remaining pleasant to drink. Balance in the use of smoke, hops and malt character is exhibited by the better examples.</impression>
        <aroma>The aroma should be a pleasant balance between the expected aroma of the base beer and the smokiness imparted by the use of smoked malts. The intensity and character of the smoke and base beer style can vary, with either being prominent in the balance. Smokiness may vary from low to assertive; however, balance in the overall presentation is the key to well-made examples. The quality and secondary characteristics of the smoke are reflective of the source of the smoke (e.g., alder, oak, beechwood). Sharp, phenolic, harsh, rubbery, or burnt smoke-derived aromatics are inappropriate.</aroma>
        <appearance>Variable. The appearance should reflect the base beer style, although the color of the beer is often a bit darker than the plain base style.</appearance>
        <flavor>As with aroma, there should be a balance between smokiness and the expected flavor characteristics of the base beer style. Smokiness may vary from low to assertive. Smoky flavors may range from woody to somewhat bacon-like depending on the type of malts used. The balance of underlying beer characteristics and smoke can vary, although the resulting blend should be somewhat balanced and enjoyable. Smoke can add some dryness to the finish. Harsh, bitter, burnt, charred, rubbery, sulfury, medicinal, or phenolic smoky characteristics are generally inappropriate (although some of these characteristics may be present in some base styles; however, the smoked malt shouldn’t contribute these flavors).</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Varies with the base beer style. Significant astringent, phenolic smoke-derived harshness is inappropriate.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>This style is for any beer that exhibits smoke as a principal flavor and aroma characteristic other than the Bamberg-style <em>Rauchbier</em> (i.e., beechwood-smoked <em>Märzen</em>), which has its own style. Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a pleasant balance between the smoke character and the base beer style. Entries should be judged on how well that style is represented, and how well it is balanced with the smoke character. Entries with a specific type or types of smoke cited will be judged on how well that type of smoke is recognizable and marries with the base style. Judges should evaluate the beers mostly on the overall balance, and how well the smoke character enhances the base beer.</comments>
        <history>The process of using smoked malts has been adapted by craft brewers to many styles. German brewers have traditionally used smoked malts in bock, doppelbock, weissbier, dunkel, schwarzbier, helles, Pils, and other specialty styles.</history>
        <ingredients>Different materials used to smoke malt result in unique flavor and aroma characteristics. Beechwood, or other hardwood (oak, maple, mesquite, alder, pecan, apple, cherry, other fruitwoods) smoked malts may be used. The various woods may remind one of certain smoked products due to their food association (e.g., hickory with ribs, maple with bacon or sausage, and alder with salmon). Evergreen wood should never be used since it adds a medicinal, piney flavor to the malt. Noticeable peat-smoked malt is universally undesirable due to its sharp, piercing phenolics and dirt-like earthiness. The remaining ingredients vary with the base style. If smoked malts are combined with other unusual ingredients (fruits, vegetables, spices, honey, etc.) in noticeable quantities, the resulting beer should be entered in the Specialty Smoked Beer.</ingredients>
        <entryinstructions>The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify a <em>Classic Style</em> base beer. The entrant <strong>must</strong> specify the type of wood or smoke <strong>if</strong> a varietal smoke character is noticeable.</entryinstructions>

      <name>Wood Beer</name>
      <notes>This category contains specialty beers with a wood-aged character, with or without added alcohol character.</notes>
      <subcategory id="33A">
        <name>Wood-Aged Beer</name>
        <notes>This style is intended for beer aged in wood without added alcohol character from previous use of the barrel. Bourbon-barrel or other similar beers should be entered as a <em>Specialty Wood-Aged Beer</em>.</notes>
        <impression>A harmonious blend of the base beer style with characteristics from aging in contact with wood. The best examples will be smooth, flavorful, well-balanced and well-aged.</impression>
        <aroma>Varies with base style. A low to moderate wood- or oak-based aroma is usually present. Fresh wood can occasionally impart raw “green” aromatics, although this character should never be too strong. Other optional aromatics include a low to moderate vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, or cocoa character from any char on the wood. Any alcohol character should be smooth and balanced, not hot. Some background oxidation character is optional, and can take on a pleasant, sherry-like character and not be papery or cardboard-like. Should not have added alcohol character.</aroma>
        <appearance>Varies with base style. Often darker than the unadulterated base beer style, particularly if toasted/charred barrels are used.</appearance>
        <flavor>Varies with base style. Wood usually contributes a woody or oaky flavor, which can occasionally take on a raw “green” flavor if new wood is used. Other flavors that may optionally be present include vanilla (from vanillin in the wood); caramel, butterscotch, toasted bread or almonds (from toasted wood); and coffee, chocolate, cocoa (from charred wood). The wood and/or other cask-derived flavors should be balanced, supportive and noticeable, but should not overpower the base beer style. Some background oxidation character is optional, although this should take on a pleasant, sherry-like character and not be papery or cardboard-like.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Varies with base style. Wood can add tannins to the beer, depending on age of the cask. The tannins can lead to additional astringency (which should never be high), or simply a fuller mouthfeel. Tart or acidic characteristics should be low to none, and never distracting.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>The base beer style should be apparent. The wood-based character should be evident, but not so dominant as to unbalance the beer. The intensity of the wood-based flavors is based on the contact time with the wood; the age, condition, and origin and char level of the barrel; and the type of wood. THIS CATEGORY SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR BASE STYLES WHERE WOOD-AGING IS A FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE STYLE (e.g., Flanders Red, Lambic, etc.). <em>Beers made using either limited wood aging or products that only provide a subtle background character may be entered in the base beer style categories as long as the wood character isn’t prominently featured.</em> </comments>
        <history>A traditional production method that is rarely used by major breweries, and usually only with specialty products. More popular with modern American craft breweries looking for new, distinctive products. Oak cask and barrels are traditional, although other woods are becoming more popular.</history>
        <ingredients>Varies with base style. Aged in wooden casks or barrels, or using wood-based additives (wood chips, wood staves, oak essence). Fuller-bodied, higher-gravity base styles often are used since they can best stand up to the additional flavors, although experimentation is encouraged.</ingredients>

        <paragraph>The following discussion applies to all the mead styles, except where explicitly superseded in the sub-category guidelines.

            <definition>A mead may be <em>dry</em>, <em>semi-sweet</em>, or <em>sweet</em>. Sweetness simply refers to the amount of residual sugar in the mead. Sweetness is often confused with fruitiness in a dry mead. Body is related to sweetness, but dry meads can still have some body. Dry meads do not have to be bone dry. Sweet meads should not be cloyingly sweet, and should not have a raw, unfermented honey character. Sweetness is independent of strength. Note that tannin levels can affect the perceived sweetness of mead (more tannin makes a mead seem drier), but acidity is more related to the quality, balance, and enjoyment of the sweetness. The purpose of identifying a sweetness level is primarily to aid in the ordering of a flight. <em>Minor differences from stated sweetness level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault.</em> </definition>

            <definitionterm>Carbonation</definitionterm>
            <definition>A mead may be <em>still</em>, <em>petillant</em>, or <em>sparkling</em>. Still meads do not have to be totally flat; they can have some very light bubbles. Petillant meads are lightly sparkling and can have a moderate, noticeable amount of carbonation. Sparkling meads are not gushing, but may have a character ranging from mouth-filling to an impression akin to Champagne or carbonated water. <em>Minor differences from stated carbonation level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault</em> </definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Strength</definitionterm>
            <definition>A mead may be categorized as <em>hydromel</em>, <em>standard</em>, or <em>sack</em> strength. Strength refers to the alcohol content of the mead (and also, therefore, the amount of honey and fermentables used to make the mead). Stronger meads can have a greater honey character and body (as well as alcohol) than weaker meads, although this is not a strict rule. Well-made stronger examples may have difficult-to-detect strength. <em>Minor differences from stated strength level should not be heavily-penalized or considered a disqualifying fault.</em> </definition>

          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Honey variety.</definitionterm>
            <definition>Some types of honey have a strong varietal character (aroma, flavor, color, acidity). If a honey is unusual, additional information can be provided to judges as to the character to be expected. Note that <em>wildflower</em> isn’t a varietal honey; it is specifically a term used to describe a honey derived from an unknown source or from mixed flowers or blossoms. Consider providing a description of the honey if it is not listed in the Mead Exam Study Guide or other BJCP references. Identifying the source (state or region) and season of the honey can be useful information for the judges.</definition>

            <definitionterm>Special ingredients.</definitionterm>
            <definition>Different styles may include fruit, spice, malt, etc. Judges need to understand the ingredients that provide a unique character in order to properly evaluate the mead. Oak additions do not have to be specified (but may be at the entrant’s discretion); <em>oaking is acceptable in every mead style</em>. Excessive oaking is a fault, just as in wine; any use of oak should be balanced and complimentary. A declared use of oak should not be interpreted as requiring the oak to be a primary flavor.</definition>

        <sectiontitle>2. Standard Description for Mead</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>When individual mead style descriptions use the phrase <strong>Standard Description Applies</strong>, refer to the sections below that have the same names as are used in the style descriptions. These descriptions are incorporated by reference into every style where they are mentioned. Statements in the individual style descriptions build on, modify, or supersede the standard descriptions below.</paragraph>
        <definitionlist>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Appearance:</definitionterm>
            <definition>Clarity may be good to brilliant. Crystal clear, reflective examples with a bright, distinct meniscus are highly desirable. Observable particulates (even in an otherwise clear example) are undesirable. Highly carbonated examples usually have a short-lasting head similar to Champagne or soda pop. Some aspects of bubbles or head formation that may be observed and commented upon include size (large or small), persistence (how long do they continue to form?), quantity (how much are present?), rate (how fast do they form?), and mousse (appearance or quality of foam stand). The components of bubbles (or <em>head</em>) will vary greatly depending on the carbonation level, ingredients and type of mead. In general, smaller bubbles are more desirable and indicative of higher quality than larger bubbles. The color may vary widely depending on honey variety and any optional ingredients (e.g., fruit, malts). Some honey varieties are almost clear, while others can be dark brown. Most are in the straw to gold range. If no honey variety is declared, almost any color is acceptable. If a honey variety is declared, the color should generally be suggestive of the honey used (although a wide range of color variation is still possible). Hue, saturation and purity of color should be considered. Stronger versions (standard and sack) may show signs of body (e.g., legs, meniscus) but higher carbonation levels can interfere with this perception.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Aroma:</definitionterm>
            <definition>The intensity of the honey aroma will vary based upon the sweetness and strength of the mead. Stronger or sweeter meads may have a stronger honey aroma than drier or weaker versions. Different varieties of honey have different intensities and characters; some (e.g., orange blossom, buckwheat) are more readily recognizable than others (e.g., avocado, palmetto). If honey varieties are declared, the varietal character of the honey should be apparent even if subtle. The aromatics may seem vinous (similar to wine), and may include fruity, floral, or spicy notes. The bouquet (rich, complex aromatics arising from the combination of ingredients, fermentation and aging) should show a pleasant, clean fermentation character, with fresh aromatics being preferred over dirty, muddled, yeasty, or sulfury notes. A multi-faceted bouquet, also known as complexity or depth, is a positive attribute. Phenolic aromatics should not be present. Harsh or chemical aromatics should not be present. Oxidation is a big detraction in most mead, and most frequently appears as a strong sherry-like or light molasses-like character. A subtle, sherry-like oxidation character can add complexity in some situations, but not if the oxidation ruins the character of the mead. Alcohol aromatics may be present, but hot, solventy or irritating overtones are a defect. The harmony and balance of the aroma and bouquet should be pleasant and enticing.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Flavor:</definitionterm>
            <definition>The intensity of the honey flavor will vary based upon the sweetness and strength of the mead. Stronger, sweeter meads will have a stronger honey flavor than drier, weaker versions. Different varieties of honey have different intensities and characters; some (e.g., orange blossom, buckwheat) are more readily recognizable than others (e.g., safflower, palmetto). If honey varieties are declared, the varietal character of the honey should be apparent even if subtle. The residual sweetness level will vary with the sweetness of the mead; dry meads will have no residual sugar, sweet meads will have noticeable to prominent sweetness, semi-sweet meads will have a balanced sweetness. In no case should the residual sweetness be syrupy, cloying or seem like unfermented honey. Any additives, such as acid or tannin, should enhance the honey flavor and lend balance to the overall character of the mead but not be excessively tart or astringent. Tannin can make a mead seem drier than the residual sugar levels might suggest. Artificial, chemical, harsh, phenolic or bitter flavors are defects. Higher carbonation (if present) enhances the acidity and gives a “bite” to the finish. The aftertaste should be evaluated; longer finishes are generally most desirable. A multi-faceted flavor, also known as complexity or depth, is a positive attribute. Yeast or fermentation characteristics may be none to noticeable, with estery, fresh and clean flavors being most desirable. Alcohol flavors (if present) should be smooth and well-aged, not harsh, hot, or solventy. Very light oxidation may be present, depending on age, but an excessive molasses, sherry-like or papery character should be avoided. Aging and conditioning generally smooth out flavors and create a more elegant, blended, rounded product. All flavors tend to become more subtle over time, and can deteriorate with extended aging.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Mouthfeel:</definitionterm>
            <definition>Before evaluating, refer to the declared sweetness, strength and carbonation levels, as well as any special ingredients; these can all affect mouthfeel. Well-made examples will often have an elegant wine-like character. The body can vary widely, although most are in the medium-light to medium-full range. Body generally increases with stronger and/or sweeter meads, and can sometimes be quite full and heavy. Similarly, body generally decreases with lower gravity and/or drier meads, and can sometimes be quite light. Sensations of body should not be accompanied by an overwhelmingly cloying sweetness (even in sweet meads). A very thin or watery body is likewise undesirable. Some natural acidity is often present (particularly in fruit-based meads). Low levels of astringency are sometimes present (either from specific fruit or spices, or from tea, chemical additives or oak-aging). Acidity and tannin help balance the overall honey, sweetness and alcohol presentation. The level of carbonation can vary widely (see definitions above). Still meads may have a very light level of carbonation, lightly carbonated (petillant) meads will have noticeable bubbles, and a highly carbonated (sparkling) mead can range from a mouth-filling carbonation to levels approaching Champagne or soda pop. High carbonation will enhance the acidity and give a “bite” to the finish. A warming alcohol presence is often present, and this character usually increases with strength (although extended aging can smooth this sensation).</definition>

            <definitionterm>Overall Impression:</definitionterm>
            <definition>A wide range of results are possible, but well-made examples will have an enjoyable balance of honey flavors, sweetness, acidity, tannins, alcohol. Strength, sweetness and age greatly affect the overall presentation. Any special ingredients should be well-blended with the other ingredients, and lead to a harmonious end product.</definition>
          </definitionitem>
          <definitionitem>
            <definitionterm>Ingredients:</definitionterm>
            <definition>Mead is made primarily from honey, water and yeast. Some minor adjustments in acidity and tannin can be made with citrus fruits, tea, or chemicals; however, these additives should not be readily discernable in flavor or aroma. Yeast nutrients may be used but should not be detected. Oak aging is allowable in any category as a subtle to noticeable enhancement without causing the mead to be an <em>Experimental Mead</em>; excessive oak is a fault.</definition>

            <definition>Entrants <strong>MAY</strong> specify honey varieties used, as well as the source and season of the honey. If honey varieties are declared, judges will look for the varietal character of the honey. Note that the character of a varietal honey will be identifiable as distinct to the source flowers, but may not resemble the source plant, tree, or fruit. For example, orange-blossom honey has the character of orange blossoms, not oranges; blackberry honey is only distantly like blackberries, although it is an identifiable character. If a mead is oak-aged and the oak character is noticeable, the oaking can be specified. Judges should expect to detect oak, but not as a primary flavor.</definition>

      <name>Fruit Mead</name>
      <notes>A mead made with fruit is called a <strong>Melomel</strong> , although some melomels also have other names (cyser, pyment). We are introducing category names for certain types of melomels based on the variety of fruit used; these are more entry categories than actual styles. We selected different names for the category and subcategories to avoid the confusion of using the same names in different ways.</notes>
      <notes>See the <em>Introduction to Mead Guidelines</em> for detailed descriptions of standard mead characteristics, an explanation of standard terms, and entering instructions.</notes>
      <notes>Refer to Category M1 descriptions for additional detail on the character to be expected from dry, semi-sweet and sweet meads. Use those guidelines to judge distinctions between the various sweetness levels. Judging meads from dry to sweet is recommended as the primary ordering, with strength being the secondary ordering criterion.</notes>
      <subcategory id="M2A">
        <name>Cyser</name>
        <notes>A <strong>Cyser</strong> is a melomel made with apples (generally cider).</notes>
        <impression>In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. Some of the best strong examples have the taste and aroma of an aged Calvados (apple brandy from northern France), while subtle, dry versions can taste similar to many fine white wines. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but not necessarily an even balance. Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and apple/cider character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The apple/cider character should be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of apple-based character ranging from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal apple character (if declared) to a complex blend of apple aromatics. Some spicy or earthy notes may be present, as may a slightly sulfury character. The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics from certain apple varieties are acceptable, as is a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation (both are optional). Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Standard description applies, except with regard to color. Color may range from pale straw to deep golden amber (most are yellow to gold), depending on the variety of honey and blend of apples or ciders used.</appearance>
        <flavor>The apple and honey flavor intensity may vary from none to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). Natural acidity and tannin in apples may give some tartness and astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor and alcohol. Tannin levels may make a cyser seem drier than the residual sugar levels might suggest. A cyser may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have different intensities).

        <name>Pyment</name>
        <notes>A <strong>Pyment</strong> is a melomel made with grapes (generally from juice). Pyments can be red, white, or blush, just as with wine.</notes>
        <impression>In well-made examples of the style, the grape is both distinctively vinous and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead. White and red versions can be quite different, and the overall impression should be characteristic of the type of grapes used and suggestive of a similar variety wine. There should be an appealing blend of the fruit and honey character but not necessarily an even balance. Generally a good tannin-sweetness balance is desired, though very dry and very sweet examples do exist.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness and strength, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and grape/wine character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The grape/wine character should be clean and distinctive; it can express a range of grape-based character ranging from a subtle fruitiness to a single varietal grape character (if declared) to a complex blend of grape or wine aromatics. Some complex, spicy, grassy or earthy notes may be present (as in wine). The honey aroma should be noticeable, and can have a light to significant sweetness that may express the aroma of flower nectar. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). The bouquet should show a pleasant fermentation character, with clean and fresh aromatics being preferred. Stronger and/or sweeter versions will have higher alcohol and sweetness in the nose. Slight spicy phenolics from certain red grape varieties are acceptable, as is a light diacetyl character from malolactic fermentation in certain white grape varieties (both are optional). Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Standard description applies, except with regard to color. Color may range from pale straw to deep purple-red, depending on the variety of grapes and honey used. The color should be characteristic of the variety or type of grape used, although white grape varieties may also take on color derived from the honey variety.</appearance>
        <flavor>The grape/wine and honey flavor intensity may vary from subtle to high; the residual sweetness may vary from none to high; and the finish may range from dry to sweet, depending on what sweetness level has been declared (dry to sweet) and strength level has been declared (hydromel to sack). Natural acidity and tannin in grapes may give some tartness and astringency to balance the sweetness, honey flavor and alcohol. A pyment may have a subtle to strong honey character, and may feature noticeable to prominent varietal character if a varietal honey is declared (different varieties have different intensities). Depending on the grape variety, some fruity, spicy, grassy, buttery, earthy, minerally, and/or floral flavors may be present. Some versions (particularly red pyments) may be oak-aged, with additional flavor complexity. Tannin levels may make the pyment seem drier than residual sugar levels might suggest. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Standard description applies. Wine-like. Some natural acidity is usually present (from grapes) and helps balance the overall impression. Grape tannin and/or grape skins can add body as well as some astringency, although this character should not be excessive. Use of oak can also add this character. Longer aging can smooth out tannin-based astringency.</mouthfeel>

Warming spices and hot peppers/chiles might impart a warming or numbing impression, but this character should not be extreme or make the mead undrinkable.</mouthfeel>
        <ingredients>Standard description applies. If spices are used in conjunction with other ingredients such as fruit, cider, or other fruit-based fermentables, then the mead should be entered as a <em>Fruit and Spice Mead</em>. If spices are used in combination with other ingredients, then the mead should be entered as an <em>Experimental Mead</em>.</ingredients>
        <comments>Often, a blend of spices may give a character greater than the sum of its parts. The better examples of this style use spices subtly; when more than one spice are used, they are carefully selected so that they blend harmoniously. A mead containing only culinary spices or herbs is known as a <em>metheglin</em>.</comments>

        <name>Braggot</name>
        <notes>A <strong>Braggot</strong> is a mead made with malt.</notes>
        <impression>A harmonious blend of mead and beer, with the distinctive characteristics of both. A wide range of results are possible, depending on the base style of beer, variety of honey and overall sweetness and strength. Beer flavors tend to somewhat mask typical honey flavors found in other meads.</impression>
        <aroma>Depending on the sweetness, strength and base style of beer, a subtle to distinctly identifiable honey and beer character (dry and/or hydromel versions will tend to have lower aromatics than sweet and/or sack versions). The honey and beer/malt character should be complementary and balanced, although not always evenly balanced. If a variety of honey is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable varietal character reflective of the honey (different varieties have different intensities and characters). If a base style of beer or type of malt is declared, the aroma might have a subtle to very noticeable character reflective of the beer style (different styles and malts have different intensities and characters). A hop aroma (any variety or intensity) is optional; if present, it should blend harmoniously with the other elements. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</aroma>
        <appearance>Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics. Clarity may be good to brilliant, although many braggots are not as clear as other meads. A light to moderate head with some retention is expected if the mead is carbonated. Color may range from light straw to dark brown or black, depending on the variety of malt and honey used. The color should be characteristic of the declared beer style and/or honey used, if a variety is declared. Stronger versions may show signs of body (e.g., legs).</appearance>
        <flavor>Displays a balanced character identifiable as both a beer and a mead, although the relative intensity of flavors is greatly affected by the sweetness, strength, base style of beer, and variety of honey used. If a beer style is declared, the braggot should have some character traceable to the style although the flavors will be different due to the presence of honey. If a variety of honey is declared, the braggot should feature a subtle to prominent varietal character (different varieties have different intensities). Stronger and/or sweeter braggots should be expected to have a greater intensity of flavor than drier, lower gravity versions. The finish and aftertaste will vary based on the declared level of sweetness (dry to sweet), and may include both beer and mead components. A wide range of malt characteristics is allowable, from plain base malts to rich caramel and toast flavors to dark chocolate and roast flavors. Hop bitterness and flavor may be present, and may reflect any variety or intensity; however, this optional character should always be both suggestive of the base beer style and well blended with the other flavors. Standard description applies for remainder of characteristics.</flavor>
        <mouthfeel>Standard description does not apply due to beer-like characteristics. Smooth mouthfeel without astringency. Body may vary from moderately light to full, depending on sweetness, strength, and the base style of beer. Note that stronger meads will have a fuller body. A very thin or watery body is undesirable, as is a cloying, raw sweetness. A warming sense of well-aged alcohol may be present in stronger examples. Carbonation will vary as described in the standard description. A still braggot will usually have some level of carbonation (like a cask bitter) since a completely flat beer is unappetizing. However, just as an aged barleywine may be still, some braggots can be totally still.</mouthfeel>
        <ingredients>A braggot is a mead made with both honey and malt providing flavor and fermentable extract. Originally, and alternatively, a mixture of mead and ale. A braggot can be made with any type of honey, and any type of base beer style. The malt component may be derived from grain or malt extracts. The beer may be hopped or not. If any other ingredients than honey and beer are contained in the braggot, it should be entered as an <em>Experimental Mead</em>. Smoked braggots may be entered in this category if using smoked malt or a smoked beer as the base style; braggots made using other smoked ingredients (e.g., liquid smoke, chipotles) should be entered in the <em>Experimental Mead</em> style.</ingredients>
        <comments>Sometimes known as <em>bracket</em> or <em>brackett</em>. The fermentable sugars come from a balance of malt or malt extract and honey, although the specific balance is open to creative interpretation by brewers.</comments>

      <title>Introduction to Cider Guidelines (Categories C1-C2)</title>
      <revision number="1">2015</revision>
      <section>
        <paragraph>The following discussion applies to all the cider styles, except where explicitly superseded in the sub-category guidelines. This introduction identifies common characteristics and descriptions for all types of cider, and should be used as a reference whenever entering or judging cider.</paragraph>
        <paragraph><strong>Cider</strong> is fermented apple juice. <strong>Perry</strong> is fermented pear juice. There are two categories for cider and perry: <em>Standard Cider and Perry</em> (Category C1) and <em>Specialty Cider and Perry</em> (Category C2). The Standard category covers ciders and perries made primarily or entirely from the juice of apples or pears (but not both at once). The only adjunct permitted in the Standard category, and only in some sub-categories, is a limited addition of sugar to achieve a suitable starting gravity or to raise sweetness post-fermentation. Note that honey is not a “sugar” for this purpose; a cider made with added honey must be entered either as a Specialty cider or as a Cyser under the appropriate mead sub-category. Other sugar sources that also add significant flavors (brown sugar, molasses) would also create a Specialty cider (such as New England style).</paragraph>

      <section>
        <sectiontitle>Aroma and Flavor</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>
          <ul>
            <li>Ciders and perries do not necessarily present overtly fruity aromas or flavors — in the same sense that a wine does not taste overtly of grapes. Drier styles of cider in particular develop more complex but less fruity characters. A simple <em>apple soda</em> or <em>wine cooler</em> character is not desirable in a cider or perry.</li>
            <li>Some styles of cider exhibit distinctly <strong>non-</strong> fruity tastes or aromas, such as the <em>smoky ham</em> undertones of a dry English cider.</li>
            <li>The <strong>sweetness</strong> (residual sugar, or RS) of a cider or perry may vary from absolutely dry (no RS) to as much as a sweet dessert wine (10% or more RS). In sweeter ciders, other components of taste — particularly acidity — must balance the sweetness. The level of sweetness must be specified so organizers and judges can arrange flights of tastings and entries within flights. Tasting should always proceed from drier to sweeter. There are five categories of sweetness, expanded from three in earlier guidelines. Note that the numbers for these levels are <strong>not</strong> rigid or restrictive. They are intended to guide the cidermaker on how to enter, not to be used as judging criteria unless a cider is declared at a sweetness level far from its actual sweetness. Judges must realize that sweetness can mask faults. Be more attentive to this in a sweeter cider. Likewise, do not penalize dry ciders excessively for minor faults which may be more evident only because of lack of sweetness. The categories and <em>approximate</em> sugar levels are as follows. Final gravities are particularly rough numbers since they cannot take account of what the SG would be if the cider fermented out completely.<ul><li><strong>Dry:</strong> below 0.4% residual sugar. This corresponds to a final specific gravity less than 1.002. There is no perception of sweetness.</li><li><strong>Medium-dry:</strong> 0.4-0.9% residual sugar. This corresponds to a final specific gravity of 1.002-1.004. There is a hint of sweetness but the cider is still perceived primarily as dry. Also known as semi-dry.</li><li><strong>Medium:</strong> in the range between dry and sweet, 0.9-2.0% residual sugar, final gravity 1.004-1.009. Sweetness is now a notable component of the overall character.</li><li><strong>Medium-sweet:</strong> 2.0-4.0% residual sugar, final gravity 1.009-1.019. The cider is sweet but still refreshing. Also known as semi-sweet.</li><li><strong>Sweet:</strong> above 4.0% residual sugar, roughly equivalent to a final gravity of over 1.019. The cider has the character of a dessert wine. It must not be cloying; see notes on balance.</li></ul></li>
            <li>If a cider is close to one of these boundaries, it should be identified by the sweetness category which best describes the overall impression it gives. The five categories above were expanded from the earlier three dry-medium-sweet by splitting the dry and medium categories.</li>
            <li><strong>Acidity</strong> is an essential element of cider and perry: it must be sufficient to give a clean, refreshing impression without being puckering. Acidity (from malic and in some cases lactic acids) must not be confused with acetification (from ethyl acetate or acetic acid—vinegar). The acrid aroma and tingling taste of acetification is a fault.</li>
            <li>Ciders and perries vary considerably in <strong>tannin</strong> . This affects both bitterness and astringency (see <em>Mouthfeel</em> below). If made from culinary or table fruit, tannins are typically low; nevertheless some tannin is desirable to balance the character. The character contributed by tannin should be mainly astringency rather than bitterness. An overt or forward bitterness is a fault, and is often due to processing techniques rather than fruit character.</li>
            <li>Cider may go through a <strong>malo-lactic fermentation</strong> (MLF) which converts some or all of the sharp malic acid to softer, less-acidic lactic acid. (Perries should not go through MLF because it will cause undesirable acetification.) In ciders made with tannic apples, the MLF commonly produces ethylphenols which are evident as other flavors: spicy/smoky including smoked meat, phenolic, and farmyard/old-horse. These flavors are desirable although not mandatory in English and French styles, but must not be <em>over the top</em>. The spicy-smoky character is the most desirable of the three. Note that a dominating farmyard character may be the result of a Brettanomyces contamination rather than MLF; this is a serious fault. Also, because MLF reduces the acidity of a cider, the result should not be <em>flabby</em> or too soft; the cider must remain refreshing. Finally, judges should be attentive to the possibility of faults such as mousiness which are more likely in a higher pH cider that has gone through MLF. (Some judges may be unable to detect <em>mouse</em>; an alkaline oral rinse may be needed to confirm and reach agreement among judges.)</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Clarity may vary from good to brilliant. The lack of sparkling clarity is not a fault, but visible particles are undesirable. In some styles a “rustic” lack of brilliance is common. Perries are notoriously difficult to clear; as a result a slight haze is not a fault. However, a “sheen” in either cider or perry generally indicates the early stage of lactic contamination and is a distinct fault.</li>
            <li>Carbonation may vary from entirely still to a champagne level. No or little carbonation is termed <strong>still</strong> . A still cider may give a slight <em>tickle on the tongue</em>. A moderate carbonation level is termed <strong>petillant</strong> . Highly carbonated is termed <strong>sparkling</strong> . At the higher levels of carbonation, the <em>mousse</em> (head) may be retained for a short time. However, gushing, foaming, and difficult-to-manage heads are faults.</li>

        <paragraph>
          <ul>
            <li>In general, cider and perry have a body and fullness akin to a light wine. The body is much less than that of beer. Mouthfeel depends on tannin level. Tannic styles (English and French) will have astringent mouthfeel resembling a red wine. Full-sparkling ciders will be champagne-like.</li>

        <sectiontitle>Ingredients</sectiontitle>
        <paragraph>
          <ul>
            <li>The apple and pear varieties are intended to illustrate commonly used examples, not dictate requirements when making the style. In general, adjuncts and additives are prohibited except where specifically allowed in particular styles, and then the entrant must state them. Common processing aids, and enzymes, are generally allowed as long as they are not detectable in the finished cider. Yeast used for cider/perry may be either <em>natural</em> (the yeast which occurs on the fruit itself and/or is retained in the milling and pressing equipment) or <em>cultured</em> yeast. Malo-lactic fermentation is allowed, either naturally occurring or with an added ML culture. Enzymes may be used for clarification of the juice prior to fermentation. Malic acid may be added to a low-acid juice to bring acidity up to a level considered safe for avoiding bacterial contamination and off-flavors (typically pH 3.8 or below). Sulfites may be added as needed for microbiological control. If used, the maximum accepted safe level for sulfites (200 mg/l) must be strictly observed; moreover, any excess sulfite that is detectable in the finished cider (a “burning match” character) is a serious fault.</li>
            <li>If a cider is to have sweetness (residual sugar), this may be obtained by arresting fermentation or back-sweetening with sugar or fresh juice. In this case, entrant must ensure that the cider is stable. Turbidity, gushing, or foaming resulting from restarted fermentation in-bottle are considered serious faults.</li>
            <li>If the cider is fermented and/or aged with wood (barrel, chips, staves/strips), the type of wood and process must be declared. Except for category C2F (Specialty Cider/Perry), the wood character must be no more than barely recognizable. A cider with substantial wood/barrel character entered in any category other than C2F will be regarded as not in the style.</li>
            <li>Sorbate may be added at bottling to stabilize the cider. However, any residual aroma/flavor from excessive use or misuse of sorbate (e.g., a <em>geranium</em> note) is a distinct fault.</li>
            <li>Carbonation may be either natural (by maintaining CO<sub>2</sub>pressure through processing or by bottle-conditioning) or added (by CO<sub>2</sub>injection). In most categories, a still (completely uncarbonated) cider is appropriate. Judges must realize that carbonation can improve a naive impression of a cider and must not penalize still ciders (when declared properly) for lack of carbonation.</li>

      <name>Standard Cider and Perry</name>
      <notes>The styles represented in this category are the principal established styles. "New World" is simply a name change from the "Common" of earlier versions.</notes>
      <notes>There are known styles not represented here. In particular, Spanish (Asturian and Basque) does not yet have a style definition because there is presently insufficient appreciation and understanding, as well as a lack of commercial examples of known quality for reference.</notes>
      <notes>In the case of a cider made to a style not explicitly represented here, it should be entered in the closest applicable category. The first decision is whether the cider was made with apples with significant tannin content that gives the cider noticeable astringency or bitterness. If not, it should be entered as a New World Cider. If so, the choice is between the English and French sub-categories; this decision should be based on whether the cider tends more toward sweet, rich, somewhat fruity (French) or drier and more austere (English). For perry of a non-represented style, the decision is, as above, based on tannin content. If in doubt, enter as New World Perry.</notes>
      <subcategory id="C1A">
        <name>New World Cider</name>
        <notes>A <strong>New World Cider</strong> is made from culinary/table apples, with wild or crab apples often used for acidity/tannin balance. Compared to other styles in this category, these ciders are generally relatively lower in tannin and higher in acidity. "New World" references the style, not a location, as ciders in this style are also made in eastern England, Australia, Germany, etc.</notes>
        <impression>A refreshing drink of some substance - not bland or watery. Sweet ciders must not be cloying. Dry ciders must not be too austere.</impression>
        <flavor>Sweet or low-alcohol ciders may have apple aroma and flavor. Dry ciders will be more wine-like with some esters. Sugar and acidity should combine to give a refreshing character. Acidity is medium to high, refreshing, but must not be harsh or biting.</flavor>
        <appearance>Clear to brilliant, pale to medium gold in color.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Medium body. Some tannin should be present for slight to moderate astringency, but little bitterness.</mouthfeel>

        <name>English Cider</name>
        <notes><strong>English Cider</strong> includes the English "West Country" plus ciders inspired by that style. These ciders are made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making. English ciders are traditionally fermented and aged in wood barrels, which adds some character; however, the barrels used are rarely new, so there is no overt wood character.</notes>
        <impression>Generally dry, full-bodied, austere. Complex flavor profile, long finish.</impression>
        <flavor>No overt apple character, but various flavors and esters that suggest apples, particularly tannic varieties. English-style ciders commonly go through MLF (see <em>Introduction/Aroma-and-Flavor</em>) which produces desirable spicy/smoky, phenolic, and farmyard/old-horse characters. These flavor notes are positive but <strong>not</strong> required. If present, they must not dominate; in particular, the phenolic and farmyard notes should not be heavy. A strong farmyard character without spicy/smoky or phenolic suggests a <em>Brettanomyces</em> contamination, which is a fault. Mousiness is a serious fault.</flavor>
        <appearance>Barely cloudy to brilliant. Medium yellow to amber color.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Full. Moderate to high tannin, perceived as astringency and some bitterness. Carbonation still to moderate. Bottle-fermented or -conditioned ciders may have high carbonation, up to champagne levels, but not gushing or foaming.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Sweet examples exist, but dry is most traditional, particularly when considering the drying contributions of tannin.</comments>
        <entryinstructions>Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify carbonation level (3 levels). Entrants <strong>MUST</strong> specify sweetness (dry through medium-sweet, 4 levels).

        <notes><strong>French Cider</strong> includes Normandy styles plus ciders inspired by those styles, including ciders made by various techniques to achieve the French flavor profile. These ciders are made with bittersweet and bitter-sharp apple varieties cultivated specifically for cider making.</notes>
        <notes>Traditional French procedures use small amounts of salt and calcium compounds (calcium chloride, calcium carbonate) to aid the process of pectin coagulation. These compounds may be used, pre-fermentation, but in limited quantity. It is a fault if judges can detect a salty or chalky taste. The enzyme PME (pectin methyl esterase) may also be used pre-fermentation for pectin coagulation.</notes>

        <impression>Medium to sweet, full-bodied, rich.</impression>
        <flavor>Fruity character/aroma. This may come from slow or arrested fermentation (in the French technique of <em>défécation</em>) or approximated by back-sweetening with juice. Tends to a rich fullness. MLF notes of spicy-smoky, phenolic, and farmyard are common but not required (just as with English style), and must not be pronounced. The French expect more subtle MLF character than do the English.</flavor>

        <notes>This is a cider made with characteristic New England apples for relatively high acidity, with additives to raise alcohol levels and contribute additional flavor notes.</notes>
        <impression>Substantial body and character. Typically relatively dry, but can be somewhat sweet if in balance and not containing hot alcohol.</impression>
        <flavor>A flavorful cider with robust apple character, strong alcohol, and derivative flavors from sugar additives; traditionally dry.</flavor>
        <appearance>Clear to brilliant, pale to medium yellow.</appearance>
        <mouthfeel>Substantial, alcoholic. Moderate tannin.</mouthfeel>
        <comments>Additives may include white and brown sugars, molasses, small amounts of honey, and raisins. Additives are intended to raise OG well above that which would be achieved by apples alone. This style is sometimes barrel-aged, in which case there will be oak character as with a barrel-aged wine. If the barrel was formerly used to age spirits, some flavor notes from the spirit (e.g., whisky or rum) may also be present, but must be subtle.</comments>

        <name>Ice Cider</name>
        <notes>This is a cider style in which the juice is concentrated before fermentation either by freezing fruit before pressing or freezing juice and removing water. Fermentation stops or is arrested before reaching dryness. The character differs from Applewine in that the ice cider process increases not only sugar (hence alcohol) but acidity and all fruit flavor components proportionately. No additives are permitted in this style; in particular, sweeteners may not be used to increase gravity. This style originated in Quebec in the 1990s.</notes>
        <flavor>Fruity, smooth, sweet-tart. Acidity must be enough to prevent it being cloying.</flavor>
        <appearance>Brilliant. Color is deeper than a standard cider, gold to amber.</appearance>
